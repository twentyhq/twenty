# Plan Task

Create a plan for the following task: $ARGUMENTS

## Planning Steps

1. **Understand**: Read relevant files and understand the current state
2. **Research**: Check for existing patterns in the codebase
3. **Think**: Use extended thinking to consider approaches (say "think hard")
4. **Plan**: Create a numbered list of concrete steps
5. **Confirm**: Present the plan and wait for approval before coding

## Plan Format

Create a plan with:
- Clear objective (one sentence)
- Prerequisites (what needs to exist)
- Steps (numbered, concrete, checkable)
- Verification (how to know it worked)
- Risks (what could go wrong)

## Rules

- Do NOT write code until the plan is approved
- Check @docs/architecture/ai-layer-architecture.md for structural decisions
- If touching database, include migration steps
- If touching MCP tools, include testing steps
