# Folder Architecture

In this guide, you will explore the details of the project directory structure and how it contributes to the organization and maintainability of Twenty.

By following this folder architecture convention, it is easier to find the files related to specific features and ensure that the application is scalable and maintainable.

```
front
└───modules
│   └───module1
│   │   └───submodule1
│   └───module2
│   └───ui
│   │   └───buttons
└───pages
└───...
```

## Pages

Contains the top-level components that are defined by the application routes. They import more low-level components from the modules folder (more details below).

## Modules

Each module represents a feature or a group of feature, comprising its specific components, states, and operational logic.
They should all follow the structure below. You can nest modules within modules; We often refer to them as submodules but the same rules apply.

```
module1
  └───components
  │   └───component1
  │   └───component2
  └───constants
  └───contexts
  └───graphql
  │   └───fragments
  │   └───queries
  │   └───mutations
  └───hooks
  │   └───internal
  └───states
  │   └───recoil-scope-contexts
  │   └───selectors
  └───types
  └───utils
```

### Contexts

A context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

See [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react#context-hooks) for more details

### States

Contains the state management logic. We use [RecoilJS](https://recoiljs.org) for this.

- Selectors

  See [RecoilJS Selectors](https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/selectors) for more details.

- Recoil Scope Contexts

  More details will be added soon.

We still use React's built-in state management for state that is only used within a component.

### Hooks

See [Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) for more details.

### Utils

Should only contain reusable pure functions. Otherwise, create custom hooks in the `hooks` folder.

### GraphQL

Includes fragments, queries, and mutations.

See [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) for more details.

- Fragments

  A fragment is a reusable piece of a query, which can be used in multiple places. By using fragments, it is easier to avoid duplicating code.

  See [GraphQL Fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) for more details.

- Queries

  See [GraphQL Queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) for more details.

- Mutations

  See [GraphQL Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) for more details.

## UI

Contains all of the reusable UI components used in the application.

This folder can contain subfolders for specific types of components, such as `buttons`, `inputs`, or `modals`. Each component should be self-contained and reusable, so that it can be used in multiple parts of the application.

By separating the UI components from the other components in the `modules` folder, it is easier to maintain a consistent design and to make changes to the UI without affecting other parts (business logic) of the codebase.

## Interface and dependencies

You can import other module code from any module except for the `ui` folder. This will keep its code easy to test.

### Internal

Each part (hooks, states, ...) of a module can have an `internal` folder, which contains parts that are only used within the module.
