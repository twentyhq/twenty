This guide will walk you through provisioning the project with Docker. This comes with a few advantages:
- It provides the exact same environment as our core developer team.
- It includes some additional dependencies (such as `playwright`) that you might need if you wish to contribute to some advanced areas of the project.
- It provisions a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) versions installed on your computer.

You can run `docker --version` to verify the installation.

## Step #1: Git Clone
In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```

## Step #2: Setup env variables

Twenty requires a few environment variables to be set. Locally, we recommend setting them through `.env` files.

```bash
cp ./front/.env.example ./front/.env
cp ./server/.env.example ./server/.env 
```

The default values should work out of the box, except for the postgres URL, which requires a small modification.

Open `./server/.env` and change to the following:

```bash
PG_DATABASE_URL=postgres://twenty:twenty@postgres:5432/default?connection_limit=1
```


## Step #3: Build

We provide an environment containerized with Docker and orchestrated with `docker-compose`.
This installation method will also provision a PostgreSQL container.

> **Note:** The configuration for the build is stored in the `infra/dev` folder, but you can run `make` commands directly from the root folder.

```bash
make build
```

## Step #4: Migrate & seed

Before running the project, you need to initialize the database by running the migrations and seed.

Start the containers:
```bash
make up
```

Run database migrations, generate prisma client, and seed:
```bash
make server-prisma-reset
```

## Step #5: Start Twenty

Run the project with the following commands from the `root folder`:

```bash
make server-start
```

```bash
make front-start
```

You should now have:
- **Frontend** available on: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- **Server** available on: [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)
- **Postgres** available on [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432) and containing database named `default`

Sign in using our seeded demo account `tim@apple.dev` (password: `Applecar2025`) to start using Twenty

### Optional

If you don't want to use the `make` command and work directly from the container, you can also ssh directly into the container:

```bash
make sh
```
Then run commands through yarn:
```bash
cd server
yarn prisma:reset
```


### Troubleshooting

#### Docker throws errors while setting up local environment

If by any chance you run into problems with Docker, you should change the `docker-compose` to `docker compose` in `./infra/dev/Makefile` as `docker-compose` is an old version
that's becoming slowly obsolete. (More info can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/))
