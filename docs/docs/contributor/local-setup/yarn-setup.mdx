In this document, you'll learn how to install the project using yarn. You should use this method since it's the easiest way to get started but you can also run the project with [Docker](/contributor/local-setup/docker-setup).  

:::info
`npm` does not support local packages well, opt for `yarn` instead.
:::

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Linux and MacOS" default>

Before you can install and use Twenty, make sure you install the following on your computer:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
- [yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) 
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wsl" label="Windows (WSL)" >

1. Install WSL
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```
You should now see a prompt to restart your computer. If not, restart it manually.

Upon restart, a powershell window will open and install Ubuntu. This may take up some time.
You'll see a prompt to create a username and password for your Ubuntu installation.

2. Install and configure git

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```

3. Install Node.js, nvm, yarn
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```
Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm. 

:::caution Note

Avoid using Docker on WSL as it adds an extra layer of complexity.

## Step 1: Git Clone

In your terminal, run the following command. 

:::info Note

It's better to use SSH for this step. If you already haven't set up SSH keys, please do so first. You can learn more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh). 

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH (Recommended)" default>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="https" label="HTTPS" >

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 2: Set up PostgreSQL Database
You need to have a PostgreSQL instance available to be able to use Twenty.
You need to provision this database with a `twenty` user (password: `twenty`), a `default` database and a `test` database.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
<b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally:
<br /><br />

```bash
cd twenty
make provision-postgres-linux
```

<b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
<br /><br />

```bash
cd twenty
make provision-postgres-docker
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac-os" label="Mac OS" default>

<b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally:
<br /><br />

```bash
cd twenty
make provision-postgres-macos-intel #for intel architecture
make provision-postgres-macos-arm #for M1/M2/M3 architecture
```

<b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
<br /><br />

```bash
cd twenty
make provision-postgres-docker
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wsl" label="Windows (WSL)">

It's better to provision your database locally:
```bash
cd twenty
make provision-postgres-linux
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 3: Setup environment variables

Twenty requires you to set some environment variables. Locally, you should set them through a `.env` file.

To do so, make copies of the `.env.example` files in `/front` and `/server`:
```bash
cp ./front/.env.example ./front/.env
cp ./server/.env.example ./server/.env
```

## Step 4: Server setup

:::info

Use `nvm` to install the correct `node` version. The `server/.nvmrc` ensures all contributors use the same version.

:::

To build Twenty server and seed some data into your database, run the following commands:
```bash
cd server
nvm install #recommended
nvm use #recommended 
yarn
yarn database:init
yarn start:dev
```

Twenty's server will be up and running at [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql).

## Step 5: Frontend setup

:::info

For the frontend setup, too, it's better to use `nvm` to install the right node version. 

:::

To set up the frontend, run the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
cd front
nvm install #recommended
nvm use #recommended 
yarn
yarn start
```

Twenty's frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). Just login using the seeded demo account: `tim@apple.dev` to start using Twenty.

# Troubleshouting

## Error: Failed to execute init.sql script.

```bash
cp: ./infra/dev/postgres/init.sql: No such file or directory
psql: error: /tmp/init.sql: No such file or directory
```

If you get this error it means you are not launching the local database init script from the repo's root folder. Make sure you're in `twenty/` and not in `twenty/infra/dev/scripts`.
