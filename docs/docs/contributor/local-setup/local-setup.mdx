Twenty is designed to be developer-friendly, and your local installation should be up and running in a few minutes.

## Discord

If you have any questions or need help, you can join our [Discord](https://twenty.com/discord) server.

## MacOS and Linux users

We recommend using [yarn installation](/contributor/local-setup/yarn-setup) as this is the easiest way to get started.
We also provide an easy way to run the project with [Docker](/contributor/local-setup/docker-setup) that you can use if you are familiar with containerized environments.

## Windows users

Windows users can install the project through WSL2. We provide a [guide](/contributor/local-setup/wsl-setup) to help you get started.

## Project structure

The repository is structured as follows:
```
twenty
└───docs // contains this documentation
└───front // contains the frontend code for the application
└───server // contains the backend code for the application
└───infra // contains docker configurations for development and production deployments
```

## IDE Setup

Once Twnenty is running on your computer, you will get the best experience by using an IDE that supports TypeScript and ESLint.
You will find a guide for [VSCode](/contributor/local-setup/ide-setup) further in the documentation.
