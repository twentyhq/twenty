# Data collected
We record page view events using a unique identifier for each workspace/user.
Additionally we also collect the workspace's domain.
We do not set any cookie for telemetry.
We do not collect any email, first name, last name, phone number, date of birth, address, username, etc.

# Opting-out of telemetry
Opting out is simple. To do this, edit your .env on the server side and include the following:
```
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
