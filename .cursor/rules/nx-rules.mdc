# Nx Guidelines

## Core Commands
```bash
# Run target for specific project
nx run twenty-front:build
nx run twenty-server:test

# Run target for all projects
nx run-many --target=build --all
nx run-many --target=test --projects=twenty-front,twenty-server

# Generate/modify projects
nx g @nx/react:app my-app
nx g @nx/react:component my-component
```

## Project Structure
- Each package has a `project.json` with targets
- Dependencies managed through `tsconfig.json` path mappings
- Shared libraries in `packages/` directory

## Build Targets
```json
// project.json
{
  "targets": {
    "build": {
      "executor": "@nx/vite:build",
      "options": { "outputPath": "dist/packages/twenty-front" }
    },
    "test": {
      "executor": "@nx/jest:jest",
      "options": { "jestConfig": "packages/twenty-front/jest.config.ts" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependency Graph
```bash
# View project dependencies
nx graph

# Check what's affected by changes
nx affected --target=test
nx affected --target=build --base=main
```

## Library Management
- Use `@nx/workspace:library` generator for shared libs
- Internal imports use `@/` path mapping
- Libraries must export through index.ts barrel files

## Cache Configuration
- Nx caches build outputs and test results
- Configure `outputs` in project.json targets
- Use `inputs` to define what invalidates cache

```json
{
  "build": {
    "outputs": ["dist/packages/my-app"],
    "inputs": ["source", "^source"],
    "cache": true
  }
}
```
