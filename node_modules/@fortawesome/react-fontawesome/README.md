## Documentation

`react-fontawesome` now supports `forwardRef` for version `0.2.x` or above. This was a breaking change so if you are using React older than version 16.3.0 choose the `0.1.x` version of this component.

## Compatibility
| React version | react-fontawesome version |
| - | - |
| < 16.3.0 | 0.1.x |
| >= 16.3.0 | 0.2.x |
