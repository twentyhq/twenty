# About
At Twenty PBC, we are building an Open Source CRM designed to be: Enjoyable to use, easily extendable, perfectly in-sync with your data. We think that being open source will better serve our customer needs and could also benefit the open source community.

**For our users:**
- Transparency on what we are building.
- An opportunity to be a decisive actor of your own tool by contributing to the roadmap.
  
**For the community:**
- A CRM you can self-host for free under AGPL license
- The power of an Open-Source project backed by a funded company
- Reusuable components such as tables or kanban

# Helping us
- The easiest way to help us is to star the repo and helping us getting visibility.
- Contributions are, of course, most welcome! It doesn't have to be code, you could also create an [issue](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues) to report a bug you've spotted, join [discussions](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/discussions) or write documentation.

# Quickstart
You can access and use the alpha version on [app.twenty.com](https://app.twenty.com), our cloud offering. We'll also release click-to-deploy buttons for Render and Railway.

In the meantime, you can check [the documentation](https://docs.twenty.com/start/local-setup). It shouldn't take more than a few minutes to install locally.

# Documentation
The doc is available on [docs.twenty.com](https://docs.twenty.com)

# Features
We are currently in the development phase of Twenty's alpha version. We are releasing new features on a biweekly basis. As mentionned above, do not hesitate to add issues if you need something specific, we'll do our best to ship it.

You can add, filter, sort, edit and track your customers in a table:
