## About Kanban Views

Kanban views visually map out process flows, where each column stands for a distinct stage and each card represents a record.

## Move Cards between Stages

 You can move each card between stages as it goes through your workflow by dragging and dropping. To proceed, hold your click on a card and move it to the next stage.

## Add and delete stages

You can tailor your workflow to suit your needs using stages, which represent a value in a Select Field:

### Add Stages

To add a stage, access the Select Field Settings by navigating to Settings > Data Model, selecting your object, and then the field your Kanban board depends on.

You can also rearrange the order of fields by holding down the field name and dragging it to where you want it.
