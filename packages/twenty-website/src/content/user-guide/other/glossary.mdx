## Company & People
The CRM has two fundamental types of records:
- A `Company` represents a business or organization.
- `People` represent your company's current and prospective customers or clients.

## Kanban
A `Kanban` is a way to track a business process. Pipelines are present within a *module* and have *stages*:
- A **module** has the logic for a certain business process (for example: sales, recruiting).
- **Stages** map the steps in your process (for example: new, ongoing, won, lost).

## Views 
You can customize the display of your records using views, setting different filters and sorting options for each view.

## Workspace
A `Workspace` typically represents a company using Twenty. It holds all the records and data that you and your team members add to Twenty.   
It has a single domain name, which is typically the domain name your company uses for employee email addresses.
