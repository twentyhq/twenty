## What can I do with workflows?
There are two main categories of actions you can automate using the workflows.
  1. Automate the busy work within Twenty to reduce what your team needs to update manually while maintaining an up-to-date CRM.
  2. Bring data in and out of Twenty from your other tools: forms, product data, enrichment, call recorders, invoicing solution and so on.

Let's deep dive into a few examples before getting into the how.  

## 1. Automate the busy work
Your CRM is only helpful if the data’s up to date — but no one likes updating it manually.  
Use workflows to automate low-value, repeatable tasks.
- Bring a field from one object to another. Exaxmple:
- Automatically attach the person you've just created with the related Company record. Create one if none exist.
- Automatically update the Company tag from `Prospect` to `Customer` when an opportunity is moved to `Won`, create onboarding Tasks assigned to the relevant team and trigger an invoice.
- Automatically update the Company tag from `Customer` to `Churned` when the related subscription gets cancelled.
- Send an email alert to the company owner when a key prospect starts engaging with your solution.
- Send an email alert to the company owner when a contract end date is near or engagement drops.

To do so, you will mainly use the triggers Create/Update Records and the actions Create/Update Records, Send Email.


## 2. Bring data in and out of Twenty
If you need to bring data in and out of Twenty from your other tools, let's do this using a workflow.
Below are a few examples of what you can build.
- Create records from **form fills** on your website (flag demo requests in real-time, log job applicants, ...)
- Give your sellers the context they need to be on top of their accounts, bringing **product data** in Twenty
- Connect your **call recorder** to automatically create a Note in Twenty with the summary of a meeting and a Task with the action items
- Enrich your leads with demographics enrichment to know who your team is talking to
- Send the informations needed to generate an invoice once a deal is closed

To do so, you will mainly leverage the ```On a schedule``` and ```Webhook``` triggers, as well as the ```HTTP``` and ```Code``` functions.
