## About

Integration with Zapier is available for automating your workflows.

## Zapier

Sync Twenty with 3000+ apps using <ArticleLink href="https://zapier.com/apps/twenty/integrations">Zapier</ArticleLink>, and automate your work. Here's how you can connect Twenty to Zapier:

1. Go to Zapier and log in. 
2. Click on `+ Create Zap` in the left sidebar. 
3. Choose the application you want to set as the trigger. A trigger refers to an event that starts the automation. 
4. Select Twenty as the action. An action is the event performed whenever an application triggers an automation. <ArticleLink href="https://zapier.com/how-it-works">Learn more about triggers and actions in Zapier.</ArticleLink>
5. Once you choose the Twenty account that you want to use for your automation, you'll have to allow Zapier to access it by adding an API key. You can learn [how to generate your API key here.](/user-guide/section/functions/api-webhooks)


6. Enter your API key and click on 'Yes, Continue to Twenty.'
