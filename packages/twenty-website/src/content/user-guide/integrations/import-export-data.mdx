# Import data
- You can import data for any object using a .csv, .xlsx, or .xls file.
- Each of the files you upload needs to contain **only one type of object** (for example, only People records). 
- You can use the Import to **create or update records**.

### Download a sample file to match the expected formatting
1. Go to a view with the object you're about to import. 
2. Click on the `⋮` icon on the top right and then select `Import records`.
3. Click on `Download sample file`.

### Prepare your csv
Below are a few items to check before uploading your file. 
- Limit the number of records to **10,000 per file**.
- **Remove duplicates** from your file.
  - The unicity on `People` is set by default by the `id` and the `email`. You also have the ability to define custom fields from `People` as unique when configuring your data model.
  - The unicity on `Companies` is set by default by the `id` and the `domain`. You also have the ability to define custom fields from `Companies` as unique when configuring your data model.
  - For any other object, including custom objects, you have the ability to define some field(s) as unique. Make sure to not include duplicates when preparing your files.
- We recommend using the syntax ```https://domain.com``` when uploading your domains, as this is the one used by our connector with your mailbox and calendar.
- You can **import the relations between objects** by providing one of the unique fields of the associated record. 
  - Example: You want to attach a person to a company. Add a column in the file containing all the `People` records that contains the `id` of the company -- or its `domain`. You will be able to map this field during the upload.
  - **Important note** 
    - Relations between objects in Twenty are "One to Many". This means each record of object A can be attached to several records of object B. One company can be attached to several people. But each record of object B can belong to only one record of object A. One person can belong to only one company.  
    - **To upload relations via the Import function, you need to provide the `id` (or any other unique field) of the attached object in the file containing the records on the "Many side" of the relationship**.
    - For example, you provide the `id` or `domain` of the company when uploading people records. You do not provide the people's `id` (or `email`) when uploading the file with companies.


### Upload your file
1. Go to a view with the object you're about to import. 
2. Click on the `⋮` icon on the top right and then select `Import records`.
3. Click on `Select file`.
4. Validate the mapping of the fields.
  - You don't have to import all of them, you can choose the "Do not map" option. 
  - For relationships, it is recommended to only map one of the unique fields. 
  - You might need to also map the values of your select type and multi-select type fields.
5. Click on `Next Steps` and `Review the rows with errors`. Cells with an issue are highlighted. **You can either remove the row or update the cell directly from there**.
6. Once you're done, click on `Confirm`
