To generate an API key: 

1. Go to Settings in the sidebar on the left.
2. Under Workspace, go to Developers. Here, you'll see a list of active keys that you or your team have created.
3. To generate a new key, click on `+ Create key` on the top right. 
4. Give your API key a name, an expiration date, and a logo.
5. Hit save to see your API key. 
6. Since the key is only visible once, make sure you store it somewhere safe. 

<div class="warning">
Since your API key contains sensitive information, you shouldn't share it with services you don't fully trust. If leaked, someone can use it maliciously. If you think your API key is no longer secure, make sure you disable it and generate a new one.

## Regenerating API key
