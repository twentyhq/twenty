# Data Model FAQ

Get answers to common questions about Twenty's data model capabilities and limitations.

## Object Management

<details>
<summary>Can I reorder objects in the left navigation bar?</summary>

Not yet. Object ordering in the navigation is currently fixed, but this feature is planned for a future release.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I hide objects from the left navigation bar?</summary>

All active objects appear in the navigation. You can deactivate objects you don't need under **Settings → Data Model**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I delete standard objects (People, Companies, etc.)?</summary>

You can deactivate any standard objects but you cannot hard delete them.

</details>

## Field Capabilities

<details>
<summary>Can I create formula fields?</summary>

Formula fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. In the meantime, you can use workflows to calculate and update field values automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I have nested fields in my objects?</summary>

Nested fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. Currently, you can use workflows to bring field values from related objects. For example, to display a Company's industry on a Person record, create a custom field on People and use a workflow to sync the value.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can't I update relation field names?</summary>

Relation field names impact the API structure and cannot be changed after creation. If you need to rename a relation field, you'll need to create a new one and delete the old one.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do I need different singular and plural names?</summary>

Our GraphQL API uses both forms for different operations:
- ```createPerson``` (singular) for single record actions
- ```createPeople``` (plural) for bulk operations

This creates limitations when singular and plural forms are the same, but it improves the developer experience.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are some field names protected?</summary>

Certain field names like "Type" are reserved for system use. Choose alternative names like "Category" or "Classification" instead.

</details>

## Advanced Features

<details>
<summary>Can I create many-to-many relationships?</summary>

Many-to-many relationships are coming in **Q1 2026**. Currently, create an intermediate object with two 1-to-many relationships as a workaround.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are Morph Many relationships?</summary>

Morph Many relationships (coming **Q4 2025**) allow one object to relate to multiple different object types. For example, an Opportunity could relate to either a Person or a Company.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I reorder fields in objects?</summary>

Field reordering will be available with custom layouts in **Q4 2025**. Currently, fields appear in the alphabetical order.

</details>

## Access and Permissions

<details>
<summary>Where can I see and edit my data model?</summary>

You can access your Data Model under **Settings → Data Model**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can't I see the Data Model under Settings?</summary>

Reach out to your workspace administrator. Data model access is usually restricted to administrators only.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How many custom objects or fields can I create?</summary>

You can create as many custom objects and fields as you need - the price won't change.

</details>
