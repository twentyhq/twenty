## Standard Objects

Standard objects are predefined entities in your workspace that offer integrated, standardized intelligence requiring no extra configuration. They're part of a shared data model accessible to all users of Twenty.

### People

The `People` object stores your contacts. It includes contact details and interaction history, so you can see all your customer interactions in one place.

### Company

The `Companies` object stores your business accounts. It includes details like industry, size and location. You could add a field to detail your relationship with this account: prospect, customer, other. Companies connect to both People and Opportunities objects.

### Opportunities

The `Opportunities` object stores deal-related data. It tracks the progression of potential sales, from prospecting to closure, recording stages, deal sizes, associated account, and expected close date. You can view your sales pipeline in a kanban layout. 

## Custom objects

Custom objects let you store information that's unique to your organization and that standard objects can't handle. For example, if you're SpaceX, you may want to create a custom object for Rockets and Launches.

### Creating a new custom object 

To create a new custom object:

1. Go to Settings in the sidebar on the left.
2. Under Workspace, go to Data model. Here you'll be able to see an overview of all your existing Standard and Custom objects (both active and disabled).


<div style={{padding:'71.24% 0 0 0', position:'relative', margin: '32px 0px 0px'}}>
  <iframe 
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/926288174?autoplay=1&loop=1&autopause=0&background=1&amp;app_id=58479" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" 
    style={{
      position:'absolute',
      top:0,
      left:0,
      width:'100%',
      height:'100%',
      borderRadius: '16px', 
      border:'2px solid black'
    }}
    title="Export data"
  ></iframe>
</div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

3. Click on `+ New object` at the top. Enter the name (both singular and plural), choose an icon, and add a description for your custom object and hit Save (at the top right). Using Listing as an example of custom object, the singular would be "listing" and the plural would be "listings" along with a description like "Listings that hosts created to showcase their property."

**Note:** The singular and plural names must be different. This is required for our GraphQL API to work properly.

<div style={{padding:'71.24% 0 0 0', position:'relative', margin: '32px 0px 0px'}}>
  <iframe 
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/926293493?autoplay=1&loop=1&autopause=0&background=1&amp;app_id=58479" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" 
    style={{
      position:'absolute',
      top:0,
      left:0,
      width:'100%',
      height:'100%',
      borderRadius: '16px', 
      border:'2px solid black'
    }}
    title="Export data"
  ></iframe>
</div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

4. Once you create your custom object, you'll be able to manage it. You can edit the name, icon and description, view the different fields, and add more fields.
