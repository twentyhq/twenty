## What are Relation Fields?

Relation fields link records from one object to records in another object. For example:
- **People** → **Companies** (each person works for a company)
- **Opportunities** → **People** (each deal has a contact person)
- **Tasks** → **Opportunities** (each task relates to a specific deal)

## Creating Relation Fields

### 1. Add the Field
Go to **Settings → Data Model → [Your Object]** and click **Add Field**.

### 2. Choose Relation Type
- **Field Type**: Select "Relation"
- **Target Object**: Choose which object to connect to
- **Relationship**: Currently supports **1-to-many** relationships only. Make sure to create the relationship in the right direction. 

### 3. Configure Field Names
You'll need to set names for both sides of the relationship:
- **Source field name**: How the field appears on your current object
- **Target field name**: How the reverse field appears on the target object

<ArticleWarning>
Field names cannot be edited once the relation is saved as it impacts the API structure. Choose carefully.

## Relating to Team Members

You can create relations to any object, including **Workspace Members** (your Twenty team users). This is useful for creating ownership fields:

- **Account Owner**: Link a Company to a team member who manages it
- **Deal Owner**: Assign an Opportunity to a specific salesperson  

When you create a relation to`Workspace Members`, you'll see your team members' names in dropdown selections, making it easy to assign ownership and responsibilities.

## Best Practices

- **Plan your relationships** before creating them
- **Use clear, descriptive names** for both field names
- **Test relationships** with sample data before full implementation
