## Understanding the AGPL v3 License

Twenty is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL v3).  
This license ensures improvements to the software are shared back with the community, especially when the software is offered as an online service.

Here’s what it means for you:

## What you can do for free
- **Use it**: You can run Twenty for free, including in commercial environments. Using it as-is never requires you to publish any code.  
- **Modify it**: You can change the source code for your own needs.  
- **Redistribute it**: You can share the software with others. If you’ve modified the code, you must also make those modifications available under AGPL v3.  

## When you must share your changes
- If you **modify Twenty’s code** and make it available over a network (e.g. as a hosted service to others), you must also make your modified source code available under AGPL v3.  
- If you **only use modifications internally** (inside your company, without exposing them to external users), you do **not** need to publish them.  

## Building a product on top of Twenty
- You can build new products or services using Twenty.  
- But if your product includes modifications to Twenty and you offer it to customers, you must release those modifications as open source under AGPL v3.  
- If you want to keep modifications private while selling your product, you’ll need a commercial license from us.

**In short:**  
- Use and self-host freely.  
- Internal changes can stay private.  
- External services or redistributed products must share modifications.  
- Contact us if you want a commercial license to keep changes closed.

**Note:** This explanation is meant to give you a clear, practical sense of how the AGPL v3 works with Twenty. It’s not legal advice.  
If you’re planning something complex (like building a commercial product or running a hosted service at scale), you may want to check with a lawyer to be sure you’re in full compliance.
