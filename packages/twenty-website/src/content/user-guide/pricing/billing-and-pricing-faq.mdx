<details>
  <summary><strong>Where can I see my credit usage?</strong></summary>

  Open your `Settings` and then the `Billing` tab.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How do the workflow credits work?</strong></summary>

  Workflow credits are consumed during their execution. The more workflows you run and the more steps they have, the more credits you consume.  
  Workflow credits are shared among a workspace: they do not belong to individual users.  
  Steps that are Create/Update/Delete Records are the ones consuming less credits.  
  AI nodes (that are coming in a few weeks!) will consume more credits. This will be proportional to the complexity of the request you make.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How many workflow credits do we have?</strong></summary>

  Each workspace under trial gets 5,000 credits.  
  Each workspace under a Pro plan gets 10,000 credits per month.  
  Each workspace under an Organization plan gets 20,000 credits per month.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How many workflow credits will I need?</strong></summary>

  We will release a simulator to help you calculate the amount of credits you'll need each month very soon. We're waiting for the AI nodes to be live to do so.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I buy more workflow credits?</strong></summary>

  Yes, this is coming soon! Reach out to us directly in the meantime.
</details>

## Open-Source
<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I use Twenty for free?</strong></summary>

  Yes. Twenty is licensed under the AGPL v3, which means you can use it for free, including for commercial purposes — as long as you don’t modify the code.  
  If you do modify it and make those changes available to others (e.g. as a hosted service), you’ll need to share the modified code under the same license.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I self-host Twenty without paying?</strong></summary>

  Yes. You can deploy and run it on your own infrastructure at no cost.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do I have to open-source my code if I modify Twenty?</strong></summary>

  If you change the code and run it as a service (e.g. offer it to users over a network), you must share those modifications under AGPL v3. If you only use modifications internally, you do not need to publish them.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I build a commercial product on top of Twenty?</strong></summary>

  Yes, but if your product relies on modified Twenty code and you offer it to others, you must release those modifications under AGPL v3. If you want to keep your changes proprietary, you need a commercial license from us. Reach out to our team.
