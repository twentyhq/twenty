<summary><strong>How many workflow credits do we have?</strong></summary>

The number of credits varies based on the plan. A workspace under **trial gets 5 million credits**, one with a **Pro plan gets 10 million credits per month** and one with an **Organization plan gets 20 million credits per month**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does workflow credit consumption work?</strong></summary>

Each workflow action consumes credits based on its complexity:
- **Basic internal operations** (such as search, update, create records) consume very few credits
- **More complex operations** like code nodes and requests to external services consume more credits
- **AI prompts** (coming soon!) will also consume more credits based on usage

Credits are deducted in real-time when workflows execute. You can monitor your usage in **Settings â†’ Billing** to track consumption and remaining credits.
