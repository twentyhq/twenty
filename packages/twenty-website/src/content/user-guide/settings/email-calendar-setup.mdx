## Email Configuration

### Message Visibility
Choose different levels of visibility for your emails:

- **Metadata Only**: Share only basic information (sender, recipient, date, time)
- **Subject and Metadata**: Share subject line along with metadata
- **All Email Content**: Share entire email content including attachments

### Contact Auto-Creation
- **Deactivated**: No automatic contact creation
- **For messages sent & received**: Create contacts for all external email interactions
- **For messages sent only**: Create contacts only for emails you send
- **Note**: Internal emails (same domain) are never synced to maintain privacy

### Control which emails get sync with Message Folder Selection (Lab Feature)
Control which email folders sync with Twenty:
1. Go to **Settings → Releases → Lab** and enable **Message Folder**
2. Return to **Settings → Accounts** and select your connected email account
3. Choose which folders to sync:
   - **Inbox**: Primary incoming emails
   - **Sent**: Outgoing emails you've sent
   - **Custom Folders**: Any specific folders you want to include
   - **Exclude Folders**: Skip folders like Spam, Trash, or personal folders

This gives you precise control over which emails appear in your CRM without syncing everything.

**What Gets Synced:**
- **External Emails**: All emails with external contacts from selected folders
- **Internal Emails**: Not synced (same domain emails remain private)
- **Attachments**: Coming in H1 2026

**Note**: We don't provide a CC email address for selective syncing. Instead, use the Message Folder feature above to achieve the same level of control over which emails sync with Twenty.


## Calendar Configuration

### Event Visibility
Choose what will be visible to other users in your workspace:
- **Everything**: The whole event details will be shared with your team
- **Metadata**: Only date & participants will be shared with your team


### Contact Auto-Creation for Meetings
- **Yes**: Automatically create contacts for meeting participants not in your CRM
- **No**: Only link meetings to existing contacts


### Control which events get sync
- **Meeting Import**: Automatically import calendar events
- **Contact Linking**: Link meetings to People and Company records

**What Gets Synced:**
- **Meetings**: Calendar events with external participants
- **Contact Linking**: Events automatically linked to CRM records
- **Team Events**: Shared calendar visibility



## Sync Frequency

**Updates every 5 minutes**: Both email and calendar data sync automatically every 5 minutes after the initial import.
