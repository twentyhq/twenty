## Customize Permissions

Permissions determine what each role can access or modify within your workspace, including workspace objects records, settings, and actions.

### Object Permissions

Control access to records and fields:

- Under **All Objects**, apply permissions like **See Record**, **Edit Records**, **Delete Records**, or **Destroy Records** to all objects
- Under **Object-Level Permissions**, configure exceptions for individual objects. These override the settings from **All Objects**

To override parent permissions and apply stricter rules:

- Click **X** to remove the inherited rule
- Select the specific permissions for the selected object 
- Click the orange **Undo** icon (circular arrow) to revert changes

When done, click **Finish**, then **Save** once redirected to the role page.

### Workspace Settings Permissions

Control access to workspace settings in two ways:

- Toggle **Settings All Access** to grant full access 
- Or enable specific permissions (e.g., API key generation, workspace preferences, role assignment, data model configuration, security settings, and workflow management)

### Workspace Action Permissions

Controll access to general workspace actions:

- Toggle **Application All Access** to grant full permissions
- Or enable individual actions such as **Send Email**, **Import CSV**, and **Export CSV**
