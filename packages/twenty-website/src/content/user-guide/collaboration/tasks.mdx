Manage all tasks within your workspace using the **Tasks** feature. This guide will show you how to create and manage tasks, switch between upcoming and completed tasks, edit task details, and much more.

## Common Use Cases

### Sales Follow-ups
- **Meeting Next Steps**: Create tasks for action items discussed during client calls
- **Proposal Follow-ups**: Set reminders to check on pending proposals
- **Contract Reviews**: Schedule tasks for contract negotiations and approvals

### Customer Success
- **Onboarding Tasks**: Automatically create onboarding checklists when deals close
- **Check-in Reminders**: Schedule regular customer health check calls
- **Renewal Preparation**: Set tasks to prepare for contract renewals 90 days in advance

### Internal Project Management
Beyond sales and customer success, Tasks support broader organizational needs:
- **Product Development**: Track feature releases, bug fixes, and development milestones
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Manage campaign launches, content creation, and promotional activities
- **HR Operations**: Handle recruitment processes, employee onboarding, and performance reviews
- **Finance Tasks**: Schedule budget reviews, invoice processing, and financial reporting
- **Operations**: Coordinate facility management, vendor relationships, and process improvements

### Automated Task Creation
Use [Workflows](/user-guide/section/workflows/getting-started-workflows) to automatically create tasks:
- **Deal Won Triggers**: Auto-create onboarding tasks assigned to CS team when opportunities close
- **Email Reminders**: Set up weekly email reminders for tasks due this week (sent every Monday)
- **Pipeline Automation**: Create follow-up tasks when deals stall in specific stages
- **Meeting Integration**: Auto-generate tasks from meeting recordings or calendar events


## Task Features

### Relations Field
Tasks include a **Relations** field that allows you to attach a single task to multiple records across different objects. For example, you can link one follow-up task to:
- The Person you need to contact
- The Company they represent  
- The Opportunity being pursued
- Any relevant Notes or other records

This "morph many" relationship ensures tasks are accessible from all relevant record pages and provides complete context.

### User Tagging
**Note**: User tagging within tasks is not currently available. This feature is planned for 2026, which will allow you to mention team members and trigger notifications when assigning or updating tasks.

## Creating Tasks

Creating tasks in Twenty is seamless. You can either:

-  Go to the `Tasks`tab and press the `+` button at the top right of the page.

### Adding Task Content

Once you've created a task you can enrich it with rich content, such as Titles, Bullet points or even images. To do so, press `/` and enter the desired command.

## Viewing Tasks

The **Tasks** page displays all your tasks across your workspace. Here you can:

- Filter tasks assigned to a specific user by clicking the button with your name at the top right of the screen.
- Toggle between upcoming (`To do`) and completed (`Done`) tasks to see what needs attention and what you have accomplished.

You can also see tasks for a given Record on its `Record page`.

  <iframe 
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/927908280?autoplay=1&loop=1&autopause=0&background=1&amp;app_id=58479" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" 
    style={{
      position:'absolute',
      top:0,
      left:0,
      width:'100%',
      height:'100%',
      borderRadius: '16px', 
      border:'2px solid black'
    }}

</div>

## Editing Tasks

To edit a task, you should click on its card. This will open a side panel offering the following features:

-  **Assignee and Due date**: Update the assignee or edit the due date.
-  **Comments**: Work together with your team members by adding comments on tasks to give updates or feedback.
-  **Automations**: Thanks to the API and Webhooks, you can also automate task creation triggered by specific activities in your workspace.

## Marking Tasks as Complete

To mark a task as complete:

1. Locate the task on your `Tasks` page or within a `Record page`.
2. Click on the circle at the left of the task card - it will change to signify completion.
3. The task status will automatically update to `Done`.

This procedure will help keep an updated record of your accomplishments.

    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/927910083?autoplay=1&loop=1&autopause=0&background=1&amp;app_id=58479" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" 
    style={{
      position:'absolute',
      top:0,
      left:0,
      width:'100%',
      height:'100%',
      borderRadius: '16px', 
      border:'2px solid black'
    }}

## Delete a task

To permanently remove a task:

1. Open the task you want to delete by clicking on its card, either from the `Tasks` page or within a `Record page`.
2. Click the trash icon located in the top right corner of the task details panel.

Please note, deleting a task is permanent and can't be undone. Consider marking tasks as `Done` if there is a chance you will need to refer to them again.
