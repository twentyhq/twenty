# Email Integration in Twenty

View and manage email conversations directly within your CRM records.

## How Email Integration Works

Twenty automatically links emails from your connected mailboxes to the relevant CRM records, keeping all communication history in one place.

### Where to Find Emails

Email conversations appear in three main objects:

- **People**: View all emails exchanged with a specific contact
- **Companies**: See all emails related to a company and its employees  
- **Opportunities**: Access email threads related to specific deals

### Viewing Email Threads

1. **Navigate to a Record**: Go to any Person, Company, or Opportunity record
2. **Select the Emails Tab**: Click on the "Emails" tab to view synced emails
3. **Open an Email Thread**: Click on any email to open and read the full conversation
4. **Browse History**: Scroll through the complete email history with that contact

## What You'll See

### Email Thread View
When you open an email thread, you can:
- **Read Full Conversations**: See the complete email exchange
- **View Participants**: See all people involved in the email thread
- **Check Timestamps**: Know exactly when each email was sent
- **Access Context**: Understand the full communication history

### Email Visibility
Depending on your mailbox settings, you might see:
- **Full Content**: Complete email text and details
- **Subject + Metadata**: Subject line, sender, recipient, and timestamp
- **Metadata Only**: Basic information without email content

## Email Sync Behavior

### What Gets Synced
- **External Emails**: All emails with contacts outside your organization
- **Automatic Linking**: Emails automatically connect to existing People and Company records
- **Real-time Updates**: New emails appear within 10 minutes

### What Doesn't Get Synced
- **Internal Emails**: Emails between colleagues (same domain) remain private
- **Personal Emails**: Avoid syncing personal or non-business communications
- **Excluded Folders**: Folders you've chosen not to sync (see Selective Folder Sync below)

### Multiple Email Addresses
- **Primary + Additional**: Each contact can have multiple email addresses
- **Smart Linking**: Emails from any address link to the same contact record
- **Contact Matching**: System automatically matches emails to the right person

### Selective Folder Sync (Lab Feature)
Control exactly which email folders appear in Twenty:
- **Enable Feature**: Go to Settings â†’ Releases â†’ Lab and enable "Message Folder"
- **Configure Folders**: Under Settings â†’ Accounts, choose which folders to sync
- **Flexible Control**: Include or exclude specific folders like Sent, Archive, or custom folders
- **Real-time Changes**: Enable or disable folder syncing at any time

This gives you precise control over which emails appear in your CRM without overwhelming your workspace.
