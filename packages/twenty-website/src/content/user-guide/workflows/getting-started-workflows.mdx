## What can I do with workflows?
There are two main categories of actions you can automate using the workflows.
  1. **Automate the busy work within Twenty**: reduce the time spent by your team manually updating their CRM.
  2. **Bring data in and out of Twenty from your other tools**: forms, product data, enrichment, call recorders, invoicing solution and so on.

Let's deep dive into a few examples before getting into the how.  

## 1. Automate the busy work
Your CRM is only helpful if the data is up to date â€” but no one likes updating it.  
Use workflows to automate low-value, repeatable tasks.
- Automatically attach the person you've just created with the related Company record.
- When an opportunity is moved to `Won`, automatically update the Company tag from `Prospect` to `Customer`, create onboarding Tasks and assign them to the relevant team.
- Automatically update the Company tag from `Customer` to `Churned` when the subscription is cancelled.
- Send an email alert to the company owner when a key prospect starts engaging with your solution.
- Send an email alert to the company owner when a contract comes to an end or engagement drops.

To do so, you will mainly use the triggers `Create/Update Records` and the actions `Create/Update Records`, `Send Email`.


## 2. Bring data in and out of Twenty
If you need to bring data in and out of Twenty from your other tools, let's do this using a workflow.
Below are a few examples of what you can build.
- Create records from **web forms**: demo requests in real-time, log job applicants, ...
- Give your sellers the context they need to be on top of their accounts, bringing **product data** in Twenty
- Connect your **call recorder** to automatically create a Note in Twenty with the summary of a meeting and a Task with the action items
- Enrich your leads with demographics enrichment to know who your team is talking to
- Send the informations needed to generate an invoice when a deal is closed

To do so, you will mainly leverage the ```On a schedule``` and ```Webhook``` triggers, as well as the ```HTTP``` and ```Code``` functions.
