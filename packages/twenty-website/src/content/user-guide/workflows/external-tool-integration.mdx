# External Tool Integration Use Cases

Connect Twenty with your existing tech stack to create a unified business system. These workflows focus on bringing data in and out of Twenty through API calls and webhooks.

## Data Ingestion Use Cases

### Webform Submissions
**Problem**: You need to capture leads from website forms, landing pages, or contact forms directly into Twenty.

**Solution**: Use webhook triggers to automatically create records from form submissions.

**Setup**:
- Create a workflow with a Webhook trigger
- Configure the webhook to expect form data (name, email, company, etc.)
- Set the webhook method to POST
- Define the expected body structure in the trigger

**Workflow**:
**Trigger**: Webhook (POST request from your form)
**Actions**:
- Search Records to check if person/company already exists
- Branch: If exists → Update Record, If not → Create Record
- Create Record for follow-up task assigned to sales rep
- Send Email notification to sales team
- HTTP Request to acknowledge form submission

### Product Data Synchronization
**Problem**: Your sales team needs visibility into product usage, billing, or feature adoption data stored in your data warehouse.

**Solution**: Regularly sync product data into Twenty to give sellers context about their accounts.

**Trigger**: On a Schedule (daily or weekly)
**Actions**:
- HTTP Request to your data warehouse API
- Code action to process and format the data
- Search Records to find matching company records
- Update Record to add product usage metrics
- Create Record for tasks when usage drops below threshold

### Meeting Notes from Call Recorders
**Problem**: Important insights from sales calls get lost or aren't properly documented in the CRM.

**Solution**: Automatically create notes and action items from call recording systems.

**Trigger**: Webhook (from call recording platform)
**Actions**:
- Code action to extract meeting summary and action items
- Search Records to find the related opportunity or contact
- Create Record for a note with meeting summary
- Create Record for follow-up tasks based on action items
- Send Email to attendees with summary and next steps

### Data Enrichment
**Problem**: Your contact and company records lack important demographic and firmographic information.

**Solution**: Automatically enrich records using external data providers.

**Trigger**: Record is Created (People or Companies object)
**Actions**:
- HTTP Request to enrichment API (Clearbit, ZoomInfo, etc.)
- Code action to process enrichment response
- Update Record with additional company/contact information
- Create Record for sales task if high-value prospect identified
- Send Email alert if enrichment reveals key buying signals

## Data Distribution Use Cases

### Newsletter Subscriber Management
**Problem**: You want to send marketing emails to specific segments of your CRM data using specialized email tools.

**Solution**: Export subscriber lists to your email marketing platform when needed.

**Setup**: Create a view in Twenty with all newsletter recipients

**Trigger**: Launch Manually (when no record is selected)
**Actions**:
- Search Records using the newsletter view criteria
- Code action to format email addresses for your email platform
- HTTP Request to add subscribers to your email marketing tool
- Create Record for campaign tracking
- Send Email confirmation to marketing team

### Email Sequence Triggers
**Problem**: You want to trigger sophisticated email sequences based on CRM events using dedicated email automation tools.

**Solution**: Send new leads or customers to your email automation platform when specific events occur.

**Trigger**: Record is Created (People object with specific criteria)
**Actions**:
- Code action to determine appropriate email sequence
- HTTP Request to add contact to email automation platform
- Update Record to track sequence enrollment
- Create Record for follow-up task to monitor engagement

### Lead Scoring Integration
**Problem**: You need sophisticated lead scoring that combines CRM data with external signals.

**Solution**: Send lead data to external scoring tools or implement scoring logic within workflows.

**Option 1 - External Tool**:
**Trigger**: Record is Updated (People object)
**Actions**:
- HTTP Request to send lead data to scoring platform
- Code action to process score response
- Update Record with lead score
- Create Record for sales task if score exceeds threshold

**Option 2 - Internal Logic**:
**Trigger**: Record is Updated (People object)
**Actions**:
- Code action with scoring algorithm (company size, industry, behavior)
- Update Record with calculated score
- Send Email alert to sales rep for high-scoring leads

### Invoice Generation
**Problem**: When deals close, your billing system needs to be updated with customer and deal information.

**Solution**: Automatically send deal data to your invoicing system when opportunities are won.

**Trigger**: Record is Updated (Opportunities object, Stage = "Closed Won")
**Actions**:
- Search Records to get complete customer information
- Code action to format data for billing system
- HTTP Request to create customer in billing platform
- HTTP Request to generate invoice
- Update Record to store invoice reference
- Send Email to finance team with invoice details

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Bi-directional Sync
**Problem**: You need to keep data synchronized between Twenty and another system in both directions.

**Solution**: Combine scheduled workflows with webhook triggers for real-time sync.

**From Twenty to External System**:
**Trigger**: Record is Updated (any relevant object)
**Actions**:
- HTTP Request to update external system
- Update Record to track sync status and timestamp

**From External System to Twenty**:
**Trigger**: Webhook (from external system)
**Actions**:
- Search Records to find matching record
- Update Record with new data from external system
- Create Record for conflict resolution task if needed

### Multi-step Data Processing
**Problem**: Data from external sources needs complex processing before it can be used in Twenty.

**Solution**: Use Code actions for data transformation and validation.

**Trigger**: Webhook or On a Schedule
**Actions**:
- Code action to validate incoming data format
- Code action to transform data structure
- Code action to apply business rules and calculations
- Search Records to check for duplicates
- Create or Update Record with processed data
- Send Email alert if data quality issues detected

## Integration Best Practices

### API Rate Limiting
Be mindful of API rate limits when integrating with external services:
- Use scheduled workflows instead of real-time triggers when possible
- Implement delays between API calls in Code actions
- Monitor workflow runs for rate limit errors

### Error Handling
Build robust error handling into your integrations:
- Use Code actions to validate API responses
- Create fallback actions for failed API calls
- Send email alerts when integrations fail
- Log errors for troubleshooting

### Data Security
Protect sensitive data in your integrations:
- Store API keys securely in Twenty's settings
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Validate webhook sources to prevent unauthorized access
- Implement data encryption for sensitive information

### Testing and Monitoring
Ensure your integrations work reliably:
- Test with sample data before activating workflows
- Monitor workflow runs regularly for failures
- Set up alerts for integration errors
- Document your integration logic for team members

### Performance Optimization
Keep your workflows running efficiently:
- Minimize the number of API calls per workflow run
- Use batch operations when available
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize Code actions for performance
