# Workflow Features and Components

This technical reference covers all available triggers, actions, and workflow management features in Twenty.

## Workflow Triggers

Workflows always start with a single trigger that defines when the automation should run.

### Record is Created
Starts the workflow when a new record is created in a selected object (People, Companies, Opportunities, or any custom object).

**Configuration**: Select the object type to monitor for new records.

**Use Cases**: Lead assignment, welcome sequences, data validation, automatic task creation.

### Record is Updated
Starts the workflow when changes are made to an existing record.

**Configuration**: 
- Select the object type
- Optionally specify which fields to monitor for changes

**Use Cases**: Stage-based automations, data synchronization, alert notifications, status updates.

### Record is Deleted
Starts the workflow when a record is removed from an object.

**Configuration**: Select the object type to monitor for deletions.

**Use Cases**: Cleanup tasks, audit logging, cascade deletions, backup notifications.

### Launch Manually
Starts the workflow only when manually triggered by a user.

**Two Options**:
- **When record is selected**: Select a record, open the command panel (⌘K), and choose the workflow. The workflow runs with access to the selected record's data.
- **When no record is selected**: Open the command panel (⌘K) from anywhere and choose the workflow. The workflow runs without record context.

**Use Cases**: Data exports, bulk operations, one-time processes, testing workflows.

### On a Schedule
Starts the workflow on a recurring basis you define.

**Configuration**: 
- Select time unit (minutes, hours, days)
- Enter a value or use custom cron expressions for advanced scheduling

**Use Cases**: Data synchronization, report generation, cleanup tasks, reminder emails.

### Webhook
Starts the workflow when a GET or POST request is received from an external service.

**Configuration**:
- Receive a unique webhook URL
- For POST requests, define the expected body structure
- Configure authentication if needed

**Use Cases**: Form submissions, external system notifications, API integrations, real-time data updates.

## Workflow Actions

Actions define what happens after a trigger fires. You can chain multiple actions together.

### Create a Record
Adds a new record to a selected object.

**Configuration**:
- Select the target object
- Fill out the required and optional fields
- Use data from previous steps to populate fields

**Output**: The newly created record data is available for use in subsequent steps.

### Update Record
Modifies an existing record in a selected object.

**Configuration**:
- Select the target object
- Choose the specific record to update
- Select fields to modify and enter new values

**Output**: The updated record data is available for use in subsequent steps.

### Delete Record
Removes a record from a selected object.

**Configuration**:
- Select the target object
- Choose the specific record to delete

**Output**: The deleted record data remains available for use in subsequent steps.

### Search Records
Finds records within a selected object using filter conditions.

**Configuration**:
- Select the object to search
- Set filter criteria to narrow results
- Configure sorting and limits

**Output**: Returns matching records that can be used in subsequent steps.

**Best Practice**: Use branches after Search Records to handle "found" vs "not found" scenarios.

### Send Email
Sends an email from your workflow.

**Prerequisites**: Add an email account in Settings > Accounts

**Configuration**:
- Enter recipient email address
- Set subject line
- Compose message body
- Reference variables from previous steps for personalization

**Use Cases**: Notifications, alerts, follow-ups, automated communications.

### Code
Runs custom JavaScript within your workflow.

**Configuration**:
- Write JavaScript code in the editor
- Access variables from previous steps
- Return variables for use in subsequent steps
- Test code directly in the step

**Use Cases**: Data transformation, calculations, complex logic, API integrations, custom validations.

**Access**: Manage API keys in Settings → APIs & Webhooks

### Form
Prompts a form during workflow execution to collect user input.

**Configuration**:
- Define input fields with types, labels, and placeholders
- Configure validation rules
- Set form title and description

**Output**: Form responses are available for use in subsequent steps.

**Use Cases**: Manual approvals, data collection, user confirmations, dynamic inputs.

### HTTP Request
Sends a request to an external API as part of your workflow.

**Configuration**:
- Enter the API endpoint URL
- Select HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Add required headers and values
- Include request body for POST/PUT/PATCH requests
- Provide sample response for structure preview

**Use Cases**: External system integration, data synchronization, third-party notifications, API calls.

## Workflow Management

### Creating Workflows
1. Click "+ Add a Workflow" to begin
2. Click "Untitled" to name your workflow
3. For additional workflows, click "+ New record"

### Workflow Statuses
- **Draft**: Being edited, not yet published
- **Active**: Live version responding to triggers
- **Deactivated**: Previously active but manually stopped
- **Archived**: Past versions kept for history

### Activating Workflows
Click **Activate** to publish your draft as a new version. This makes the workflow eligible to run when triggered but doesn't immediately execute it.

### Testing Workflows
Test workflows before activation using:
- Manual triggers (when no record selected)
- Individual action testing (especially Code actions)
- Draft mode testing that doesn't activate the workflow

### Workflow Runs
A **Run** is a record of workflow execution containing:
- Status (success, failed, running)
- Output data from each step
- Author and timestamps
- Error messages if applicable

**Viewing Runs**: 
- Check the **Runs** panel in the workflow editor
- Open **Workflow Runs** view for monitoring across all workflows

### Version History
- View all versions under the **Versions** field
- Click any version to view details
- Use **Use as draft** to restore previous versions
- Handle draft conflicts with override or return options

## Best Practices

### Workflow Organization
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, specific workflow names
- **Step Naming**: Rename steps to describe their function
- **Documentation**: Add comments in Code actions
- **Categorization**: Group related workflows logically

### Performance Optimization
- **Minimize API Calls**: Batch operations when possible
- **Efficient Searches**: Use specific filter criteria
- **Error Handling**: Plan for failure scenarios
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect external API limits

### Data Flow Management
- **Branch Logic**: Use branches after Search Records
- **Variable Usage**: Leverage data from previous steps
- **Data Validation**: Validate inputs in Code actions
- **Field Mapping**: Plan data transformations carefully

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check workflow runs for errors
- **Performance Review**: Analyze execution times and success rates
- **Update Management**: Test changes in draft before activation
- **Team Coordination**: Document workflows for team members
