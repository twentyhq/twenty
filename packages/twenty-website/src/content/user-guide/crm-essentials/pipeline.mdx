## Understanding Pipelines

A sales pipeline tracks opportunities from initial contact to closed deal. Each stage represents a step in your sales process, and opportunities move through these stages as they progress toward closing.

Twenty includes standard sales stages like Prospecting, Qualification, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed. You can customize these stages to match your specific sales process.

## Working with Kanban Views

Kanban views visually map out your pipeline, where each column represents a stage and each card represents an opportunity. Each card shows key information like deal value, close date, and assigned owner at a glance. For complete details - including notes, tasks, meetings, and email history - click on any card to open the full opportunity record.

### Moving opportunities through your pipeline

You can move each opportunity between stages as it progresses through your sales process by dragging and dropping. Hold your click on a card and move it to the next stage.

### Customizing your pipeline stages

You can tailor your pipeline to suit your specific sales process. Stages represent values in a Select Field, so you can add, remove, or rename them as needed.

#### Adding stages

To add a stage, access the Select Field Settings by navigating to Settings > Data Model, selecting your object, and then the field your Kanban board depends on.
