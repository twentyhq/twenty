## Advanced Sales Capabilities

GTM teams often need advanced sales capabilities like lead scoring, data enrichment, round robin, territory assignment, automated reminders, and email sequences. While these aren't built-in features in Twenty, they can all be configured and tailored to your specific needs using our flexible workflow system.

Visit our [Workflows section](/user-guide/section/workflows) to learn how to build these automations step by step. For detailed examples, see our [Internal Automations](/user-guide/section/workflows/internal-automations) and [External Tool Integration](/user-guide/section/workflows/external-tool-integration) guides.
