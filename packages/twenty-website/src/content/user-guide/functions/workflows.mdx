## Create a Workflow

To create a workflow:

1. Click “+ Add a Workflow” to begin
2. Click “Untitled” and enter your workflow name on the upper left 
3. Once you have created one workflow, you can click “+ New record” to create additional workflows

## Delete a Workflow

To delete a workflow, click **Delete** in the top right corner of the workflow record. Confirm the deletion in the pop-up modal.

To view deleted workflows:

- Use the **Filter** option, or
- Open quick action side panel using `⌘K` and select **See deleted workflows**.

You can also save this view by clicking **Save as new view** for quick access later.

## Configure a Trigger

Workflows always start with a single trigger. It is the condition that activates your workflow. In this step, you decide when and how the automation should start. There are several types of triggers available. In this section, you’ll learn about each trigger type and how to configure one.

### Record is Created 

This trigger starts the workflow when a record is created in a selected object (e.g. People, Companies, or any custom object). To configure this trigger select the record type where the workflow should listen for a new entry.

### Record is Updated

This trigger starts the workflow when changes are made to an existing record. To configure this trigger, select the record type and optionally select the field(s) you want to listen for changes.

### Record is Deleted

This trigger starts the workflow when a record is removed. To configure this trigger, select the record type you want to listen for deletions.

### Launch Manually

This trigger starts the workflow only when manually evoked by you. You can trigger it in two ways:

- When record is selected lets you use data from that record in later steps; you'll need to choose the object, or 
- When no record is selected runs the workflow without any record context.

To manually trigger the workflow, open the side panel with `⌘K` and select the workflow. Once the run completes, reload the page to see the changes.

### On a Schedule

This trigger starts the workflow on a recurring basis you define (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly). To configure this trigger, select a time unit (minutes, hours, days) and enter a value or use a custom cron expression for more advanced scheduling.

### Webhook

This trigger starts the workflow when a `GET` or `POST` request is received from an external service. You'll receive a unique webhook URL to use as a listener.

For `POST` requests, you can define an expected body to structure incoming data and use its values in later workflow steps.

## Add an action

Once a trigger is set, you can add action steps to define what happens next. Actions use data from the trigger to carry out tasks in your workflow. In this section, you’ll explore the different action types and how to add them.

### Create a Record

This action adds a new record to a selected object. To use this action, select the object and fill out the fields. Data from the newly created record can be used in later steps of the workflow.

### Updated Record

This action makes changes to an existing record of a selected object. To use this action, select the object and select the specific record you want to update. Then, pick the field(s) to modify and enter the new values. Updated field data can be used in later steps of the workflow.

### Delete Record

This action removes a record from a selected object. To use this action, select the object and record you want to delete. 

Note: Data from the deleted record remains available for use in later workflow steps.

### Search records

This action finds records within a selected object using filter conditions. To use this action, select the object you wish to search through and set the criteria to narrow down the search results.

### Send Emails

This action allows you to send an email from your workflow. To use this action:

1. Add an email account in **Settings > Accounts**
2. Enter the recipient’s address, subject, and message body to compose your email

You can also reference variables from outputs of previous steps to further customize an action. Soon, you will have the capability to view attachments and format email content. 

### Code 

This action runs custom Javascript within your workflow. You can use this action to handle logic that goes beyond built-in actions such as transforming data, performing calculations, or integrating with external APIs. 

Any variables you create and return here can be reused in later steps of the workflow. You can also test your code directly in this step and view the output to confirm it works as expected.

Note: You can manage keys and access your API Playground [here](https://app.twenty.com/settings) or navigate to Settings > API & Webhooks (under Developers).

### Form 

This action allows you to prompt a form during the workflow to collect input from the user. The data collected can be used in later steps. To add this action, configure the input fields by selecting the type, label, and placeholder for each. 

### HTTP Request

This action allows you to send a request to an external API as part of your workflow; it can be used to integrate with external services, send or receive data, or trigger third-party actions. To use this action:

1. Paste the endpoint you want to call
2. Select an HTTP method from `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`
3. Enter any required header inputs and their values 
4. For `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`  include the body input to send with the request
5. Paste a sample response body to preview its structure and reference keys in later steps

## Executing Workflows

Workflows can be executed in three ways: **Activate**, **Run**, and **Test**. Each serves a different purpose depending on where you are in the workflow setup.

### Activate 

To activate your workflow, click **Activate** at the top to run your workflow in the background. Each activation creates a new version and moves the workflow out of draft mode.

### Runs

Runs are saved executions of active workflows. They provide details like status, output, author, and last updates. View past runs from the **Runs** field or open the **Workflow Runs** view for more specific insights that’ll be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Test

You can test workflows before activating them. This is ideal for trigger types like **Launch Manually (no record selected)** or for testing specific action nodes like **Code**. Note: Testing a workflow or individual node does not activate it. The workflow remains in draft mode.

## Workflows Statuses

Workflows have three statuses: **Draft**, **Activated**, and **Deactivated**.

When you first create or edit a workflow, it remains in **Draft** mode. Once you click **Activate**, the draft becomes a live version. For example, activating your edits turns draft changes into version v2, while the previously active version (e.g. v1) is automatically **Deactivated** and saved in the **Versions**.

This allows you to edit workflows safely in draft mode, activate when ready, and keep a record of all past versions.

## Workflow Version History

View all previous versions of a workflow under the **Versions** field in the workflow record.
Click on any version (e.g. v1, v2, v3) to view its details. To restore it, click on **Use as draft** on the top right. 

If a draft already exists, you’ll be prompted to confirm:

- **Override Draft** to replace the current draft with the selected version or, 
- **Go to Draft** to return to the version you're currently editing.
