Manage your record-linked notes efficiently using the powerful **Notes** feature. This guide walks through how to create, format, comment, and delete notes seamlessly within record pages. 

## Creating Notes

Creating notes in the system is intuitive and dynamic. You can either:

- Use the search function by pressing `cmd/ctrl + k`, then select 'Create note' from the list of quick actions.
- Go to a `Record page` and select `+` at the top right of the page, or go to the Notes tab and press the `New Note` button.

### Adding Content

Start typing directly or press '/' to add elements like headings, files, or images instantly.

### Format Content

You can format your notes right from the editor. Use Markdown syntax, press the `/` key or click on the `+` icon on the editor to see the different block options, such as headings, tables, and lists. You can also attach images to your note.

Highlight the text to see more formatting options like bold, italics, and alignment options. 

You can also change the background color and text color of each block to highlight important things in your note. To do so, hover over the block you want to format and click on the `⋮⋮` icon besides the `+` icon. Click on <b>Colors</b> to open up all color options for both the text and the background.

All edits and additions to the note are automatically saved. 

To delete a note:
