Every business works differently. That’s why Twenty lets you shape the CRM around your needs—not force your processes into ours.  
**Start with these three steps to set it up your way.**

# 1. Bring your data in
Bringing your existing data into Twenty gives your team context from the start. 
We're here to help you make this transition as smooth as possible. Do not hesitate to reach out.

## Connect your mailbox
If you have not done so when creating your workspace, connect you **Google or Microsoft account**. This allows Twenty to:
- Import your messages and meetings
- Auto-create contacts based on interactions (optional)
- Keep communication history visible for your team

You can do so under Settings → Accounts.

You control which contacts are imported in Twenty and what gets shared with the rest of your team: full message content, subject and the metadata (sender, date, subject), or just the metadata. This is the same for your meetings.
You can configure the visibility and the contact creation preferences under Settings → Email / Calendar.

#### Using another provider?
This is currently under beta: you can activate this feature under Settings → Releases → Lab tab.
You can add email accounts from any provider that supports IMAP and send emails with SMTP. Synchronizing calendars with CalDAV is coming soon!


## Import data via csv
Use the csv import to add contacts who are not in your mailbox, product data or existing enrichment you might have, as well as your previous deals, notes, tasks.
Import via csv is available for any custom object.

To import the csv file, make sure to open the Command menu ( ```Cmd + K``` or ```Ctrl + K```) from a view listing the object you're about to upload.  
Then, click on ```Import records```. 

Below are a few guidelines:

- Download the sample file to understand the expected format.
- Limit each file to 10k records.
- Remove duplicate emails for People or duplicate domains for Companies. These fields are used as unique identifiers, alongside the id fields.
- Create relations between objects using the Twenty id, the person's email or the company domain.  
Creating relations via csv based on fields other than the Twenty id for the other objects will be supported during the Fall 2025. 
- Review errors before starting the import: Potential errors are detected once the field mapping is completed. You can edit the wrong values - highlighted in yellow - directly in the UI.

# 2. Customize your data model
Twenty offers the flexibility you need to shape the data model that will best support your day-to-day.   
Create objects and fields of any type, inlcuding relations between your different objects. You can do so under Settings → Data Model.
Here are a few tips:
- **You are not limited in the number of custom fields nor custom objects**. Adding custom objects and fields will not lead to upgrading your plan.
- **People and Companies are the two objects from where you will be able to access the emails and meetings**. We recommend using those as much as possible, adding fields to categorize your records if need be. Here is an example:
  - It is best to use the People object for your prospects and partners, creating a field on the People object named ```Person Type```, instead of creating a Partner custom object (from where you will not be able to access the emails exchanged with this person).
  - Create different views under People, one to display partners and one to display prospects. 
- Two People cannot have the same email address. Two Companies cannot have the same domain. 
- You can deactivate fields and objects you do not want to use.
- You can hide fields from views: don't be afraid of creating fields, you won't have to display all of them.

# 3. Create your first Favourite view
Creating different views is key to make the data actionable for your team.
Here is how to proceed:
-  **Add or hide columns**
    - Manage the fields visible in a given view clicking on Options  → Fields (from the top right). You can show/hide fields from there.
    - If the need is punctual, hide a column clicking on its name and then ```Hide```. Add a column clicking on the ```+``` at the very right of the table and select the one you need.

- **Reorder fields**
    - Reorder the fields from a given view clicking on Options  → Fields (from the top right). Drag and drop the fields to reorder them. 
    - If the need is punctual, you can ```Move Left/Right``` a column by clicking on its name.

- **Filter records**
    - This is done from the top right.
    - Advanced filters are also available.

- **Sort records**
    - This is done from the top right, or by clicking on a column name.  

-  **Save** your view and rename it

-  **Choose the layout** 
    - You can switch to a **Kanban layout** or a **Group By** layout -- as long as the object has a “Stage” or similar select-type field.  
-  **Add it to your Favorties** 
    - This can be done using the dropdown menu showing the different views.
