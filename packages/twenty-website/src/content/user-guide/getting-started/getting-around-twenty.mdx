When you log into Twenty for the first time, the layout should feel intuitive. It’s designed to help you move fast and stay organized, without getting in your way.

## The main layout
The center of the screen is where your records live —people, companies, opportunities, tasks, notes, workflows and any other object you create. This is where the day-to-day work happens.
You can view, edit, delete records from there as well as creating new views. 

## The left bar
On the left side, from the top to the bottom, you’ll be able to:
- Switch between your several workspaces using the dropdown menu
- Choose between the light and dark modes
- Use the search bar (press ```/``` to open it instantly)
- Open the Settings section
- Have a direct access to your Favourites views. Favourites are unique for each user.
- Switch between different objects
- Create automations using workflows
- Reach out to Support and open our User Guide. Please note that our API documentation is accessible under the Settings section and not the User Guide.

## The command menu
The command menu gives you quick access to actions in Twenty.
Open it via the three dots in the top right, or press ```Cmd + K``` on Mac / ```Ctrl + K``` on Windows.

From there, you can:
- Create new records
- Import and export data via csv
- Create new views
- Access deleted records (Twenty supports soft and hard deletes)
- See the keyboard shortcuts to access object in your workspace

## Views
Every object (like Opportunities or People) supports multiple views. You're not limited in the number of views per object.

Use the dropdown in the top left of the main layout to switch between them. For example:
- Use a Kanban view to track opportunities by stage
- Use Group By view to create sections and improve efficiency
- Use filters to focus on specific records (e.g. leads created last week)
- Save filtered views to reuse them later
- Favourite views for fast access

If you’re new to Views, read <ArticleLink href="https://twenty.com/user-guide/section/objects/views-sort-filter">this article</ArticleLink> to learn how to create and customize them.

## Settings
Open your Settings on the top left to 
- Connect your mailbox and calendar accounts
- Customize your data model
- Access the API playground and configure webhooks
- Invite members
- Edit your profile
- Customize your workspace: billing, user permissions
- Discover the latest releases and the upcoming features (under the Lab)

If you do not see all those sections under Settings, reach out to your workspace administrator - some of them have a restricted access.
