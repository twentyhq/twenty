# Relation Fields on Record Page

On record pages, you can now expand relation cards to view their fields without navigating to their individual record pages. For example, on a Company record page, you can expand an employee card to view their job title. This feature applies to all types of objects, including custom ones.

# Address Field Type

The new `Address Field` Type enables entry of a full address in one field, while structurally storing each address part - such as street name and number - in separate subfields.

# Multi-Workspace

You can now switch between workspaces by clicking your workspace name at the top left of the screen. This feature will only appear if you have been invited to join another workspace.
