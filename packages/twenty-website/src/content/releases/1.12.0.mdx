# Revamped Side Panel

The side panel now opens next to your content rather than above it, giving you a better overview while configuring workflows or viewing record details. This new layout is especially handy for workflows and the upcoming dashboards feature.

# Granular Email Folder Sync

Choose exactly which Gmail labels or Outlook folders to sync on your workspace. This gives you more control over your email data and better privacy by importing only the folders you need.
