# Import Relations

When importing records, you can now import relations between records. For example, you can import a CSV file that includes a column for related records, such as linking contacts to companies or tasks to projects.

# Any Field filter

Weâ€™ve added an "any field search" filter that lets you search across all fields at once. For example, it can allow you to locate a customer by their phone number, whether it's stored in the "Mobile," "Office," or "Direct Line" field.
