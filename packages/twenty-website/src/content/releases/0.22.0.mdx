# Enhanced Kanban Board

-  **Edit Kanban Stages:** You can now edit Kanban stages directly from the app, not just from the settings. This makes it easier to manage and customize your workflow on the fly.
-  **"No Value" Column:** Cards that are not assigned to a specific value will now appear in a "No Value" column. This column can be shown or hidden as needed, ensuring no cards are overlooked.
