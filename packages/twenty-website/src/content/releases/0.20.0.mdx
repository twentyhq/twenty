# Improved Onboarding Experience

Our onboarding process has been streamlined to let you import your calendar and emails seamlessly. You can now also configure your privacy settings directly during onboarding, allowing you to choose between sharing content with your team or keeping it hidden.

# Email and calendar Blocklist

To enhance privacy, you can now add specific email addresses to a blocklist within the "Accounts" settings. This feature prevents sensitive content from being synced to the CRM when corresponding with certain individuals. This can be particularly useful when managing sensitive deals.
