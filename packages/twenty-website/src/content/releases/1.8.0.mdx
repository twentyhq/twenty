# Workflow Iterator Node

You can now loop through items in your workflows using the new iterator node. This powerful feature allows you to process multiple records sequentially, performing actions on each item in a collection.

# Workflow Bulk Select

Manual trigger workflows now support bulk selection, allowing you to select multiple records at once to pass into your workflow. This is particularly useful when combined with the iterator node to process several records in one workflow run.

# Workflow Search Node Limit

The search node now lets you customize the result limit above 1, enabling you to retrieve multiple records in a single search operation. This enhancement works seamlessly with the iterator node for processing search results.
