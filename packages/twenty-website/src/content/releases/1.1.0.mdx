# Multi-Record Workflow Triggers

You can now run workflows on multiple records at once. Previously, manual workflows could only be triggered one record at a time. This change significantly improves productivity for bulk operations.

With the ability to trigger workflows on multiple records, you can now:
- Send bulk emails to selected contacts
- Update multiple records with the same workflow logic
- Process batches of data more efficiently
