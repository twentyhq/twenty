# Multi-Record Workflow Triggers

You can now run workflows on many records at once. Previously, manual workflows could only be triggered one record at a time. This change improves productivity for bulk operations.

With the ability to trigger workflows on many records, you can now:
- Send bulk emails to selected contacts
- Update many records with the same workflow logic
- Process batches of data more efficiently
