An inbox gathering task in a CRM system is an automated process that collects and organizes various types of communications such as notes, emails, and notifications. Notes are often summaries or details related to customer interactions that can be recorded and tracked. This system also archives and prioritizes emails and notifications, making it easier to manage customer relationships and ensure all communication is accounted for and responded to in a timely manner.
