# Smart ⌘K

We started a major ⌘K revamp that now understands the context to display appropriate actions. For example, on a record page, you can add the record as a favorite, or if you select multiple records on an index, you can export them as a CSV.

# Webhooks multi-object filtering

You can now filter multiple actions simultaneously with a single webhook. For example, you can create a webhook that triggers only when a person or company is updated or created.
