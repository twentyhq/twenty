# Unlisted Views

You can now create personal views that stay out of the shared Workspace section and appear instead under a separate **My unlisted views** section in the view picker. These unlisted views are only listed for their creator, but can still be opened by teammates via direct link.

# Morph Many Relationships

Create flexible relationships where a single field can connect to multiple different object types. For example, an Opportunity can now relate to either a Person or a Company, giving you more versatile data modeling capabilities.
