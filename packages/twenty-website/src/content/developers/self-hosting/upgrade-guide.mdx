## General guidelines

**Always make sure to back up your database before starting the upgrade process** by running `docker exec -it <db_container_name_or_id> pg_dumpall -U <postgres_user> > databases_backup.sql`.

To restore backup, run `cat databases_backup.sql | docker exec -i <db_container_name_or_id> psql -U <postgres_user>`.

If you want to migrate from postgres bitnami container to postgres spilo container, you have to dump the database from the bitnami container and restore it to the spilo container using commands above.

If you used Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. In a terminal, on the host where Twenty is running, turn off Twenty: `docker compose down`

2. Upgrade the version by changing the `TAG` value in the .env file near your docker-compose.

3. Bring Twenty back online with `docker compose up -d`

If you want to upgrade your instance by few versions, e.g. from 0.33.0 to 0.35.0, you have to upgrade your instance sequentially, in this example from 0.33.0 to 0.34.0, then from 0.34.0 to 0.35.0.


## Version-specific upgrade steps

### v0.35.0 to v0.40.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.40.0 image

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.40
```

**Environment Variables**

- Added: `IS_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`, `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN`, `WORKFLOW_EXEC_THROTTLE_LIMIT`, `WORKFLOW_EXEC_THROTTLE_TTL`

### v0.34.0 to v0.35.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.35.0 image

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.35
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the database structure (core and metadata schemas)
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.35` takes care of the data migration of all workspaces.

**Environment Variables**

- We replaced `ENABLE_DB_MIGRATIONS` with `DISABLE_DB_MIGRATIONS` (default value is now `false`, you probably don't have to set anything)

### v0.33.0 to v0.34.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.34.0 image

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.34
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the database structure (core and metadata schemas)
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.34` takes care of the data migration of all workspaces.

**Environment Variables**

- Removed: `FRONT_BASE_URL`
- Added: `FRONT_DOMAIN`, `FRONT_PROTOCOL`, `FRONT_PORT`

We have updated the way we handle the frontend URL. 
You can now set the frontend URL using the `FRONT_DOMAIN`, `FRONT_PROTOCOL` and `FRONT_PORT` variables.
If FRONT_DOMAIN is not set, the frontend URL will fall back to `SERVER_URL`.

### v0.32.0 to v0.33.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.33.0 image

```
yarn command:prod cache:flush
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.33
```

The `yarn command:prod cache:flush` command will flush the Redis cache.
The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the database structure (core and metadata schemas)
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.33` takes care of the data migration of all workspaces.

Starting from this version, twenty-postgres image for DB became deprecated and twenty-postgres-spilo is used instead.
If you want to keep using twenty-postgres image, simply replace `twentycrm/twenty-postgres:${TAG}` with `twentycrm/twenty-postgres` in docker-compose.yml.

### v0.31.0 to v0.32.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.32.0 image

**Schema and data migration**
```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.32
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the database structure (core and metadata schemas)
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.32` takes care of the data migration of all workspaces.

**Environment Variables**

We have updated the way we handle the Redis connection.

- Removed: `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- Added: `REDIS_URL`

Update your `.env` file to use the new `REDIS_URL` variable instead of the individual Redis connection parameters.

We have also simplified the way we handle the JWT tokens.

- Removed: `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `LOGIN_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `FILE_TOKEN_SECRET`
- Added: `APP_SECRET`

Update your `.env` file to use the new `APP_SECRET` variable instead of the individual tokens secrets (you can use the same secret as before or generate a new random string)

**Connected Account**

If you are using connected account to synchronize your Google emails and calendars, you will need to activate the [People API](https://developers.google.com/people) on your Google Admin console.


### v0.30.0 to v0.31.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.31.0 image

**Schema and data migration**:
```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.31
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the database structure (core and metadata schemas)
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.31` takes care of the data migration of all workspaces.

### v0.24.0 to v0.30.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.30.0 image

**Breaking change**: 
To enhance performances, Twenty now requires redis cache to be configured. We have updated our [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/docker-compose.yml) to reflect this.
Make sure to update your configuration and to update your environment variables accordingly:
```
REDIS_HOST={your-redis-host}
REDIS_PORT={your-redis-port}
CACHE_STORAGE_TYPE=redis
```

**Schema and data migration**: 
```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.30
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the database structure (core and metadata schemas)
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.30` takes care of the data migration of all workspaces.

### v0.23.0 to v0.24.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.24.0 image

Run the following commands:

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.24
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the database structure (core and metadata schemas)
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.24` takes care of the data migration of all workspaces.

### v0.22.0 to v0.23.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.23.0 image

Run the following commands:

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.23
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the Database.
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.23` takes care of the data migration, including transferring activities to tasks/notes.

### v0.21.0 to v0.22.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.22.0 image

Run the following commands:

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod workspace:sync-metadata -f
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.22
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the Database.
The `yarn command:prod workspace:sync-metadata -f` command will sync the definition of standard objects to the metadata tables and apply to required migrations to existing workspaces.
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.22` command will apply specific data transformations to adapt to the new object defaultRequestInstrumentationOptions.
