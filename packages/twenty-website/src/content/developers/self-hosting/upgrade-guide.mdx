## General guidelines

**Always make sure to back up your database before starting the upgrade process** by running `docker exec -it <db_container_name_or_id> pg_dumpall -U <postgres_user> > databases_backup.sql`.

To restore backup, run `cat databases_backup.sql | docker exec -i <db_container_name_or_id> psql -U <postgres_user>`.

If you want to migrate from postgres bitnami container to postgres spilo container, you have to dump the database from the bitnami container and restore it to the spilo container using commands above.

If you used Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. In a terminal, on the host where Twenty is running, turn off Twenty: `docker compose down`

2. Upgrade the version by changing the `TAG` value in the .env file near your docker-compose.

3. Bring Twenty back online with `docker compose up -d`

If you want to upgrade your instance by few versions, e.g. from 0.33.0 to 0.35.0, you have to upgrade your instance sequentially, in this example from 0.33.0 to 0.34.0, then from 0.34.0 to 0.35.0.



## Version-specific upgrade steps
{/* 
### v0.50.0 to v0.51.0

We've now added  `yarn command:prod upgrade` to the entrypoint.sh[https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/blob/main/packages/twenty-docker/twenty/entrypoint.sh#L19] file.
This means from now on, you shouldn't have to run any command manually anymore.
Just make sure to keep upgrading your instance sequentially, without skipping any major version (e.g. 0.43.3 to 0.44.0 is allowed, but 0.43.1 to 0.45.0 is not).
You can view your instance version in the admin panel (at /settings/admin-panel, accessible if your user has canImpersonate property set to true in the database).
*/}

### v0.44.0 to v0.50.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.50.0 image

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade
```

### v0.43.0 to v0.44.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.44.0 image

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade
```

### v0.42.0 to v0.43.0

Upgrade your Twenty instance to use v0.43.0 image

```
yarn database:migrate:prod
yarn command:prod upgrade
```

In this version, we have also switched to postgres:16 image in docker-compose.yml.

#### (Option 1) Database migration

Keeping the existing postgres-spilo image is fine, but you will have to freeze the version in your docker-compose.yml to be 0.43.0.

#### (Option 2) Database migration

If you want to migrate your database to the new postgres:16 image, please follow these steps:

1. Dump your database from the old postgres-spilo container

```
docker exec -it twenty-db-1 sh 
pg_dump -U {YOUR_POSTGRES_USER} -d {YOUR_POSTGRES_DB} > databases_backup.sql
exit
docker cp twenty-db-1:/home/postgres/databases_backup.sql .
```

Make sure your dump file is not empty.

2. Upgrade your docker-compose.yml to use postgres:16 image as in the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/docker-compose.yml) file.

3. Restore the database to the new postgres:16 container

```
docker cp databases_backup.sql twenty-db-1:/databases_backup.sql
docker exec -it twenty-db-1 sh
psql -U {YOUR_POSTGRES_USER} -d {YOUR_POSTGRES_DB} -f databases_backup.sql
exit
```
