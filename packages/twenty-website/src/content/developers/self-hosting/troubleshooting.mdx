## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problem while setting up environment for development, upgrading your instance or self-hosting,
here are some solutions for common problems.

### Self-hosting

#### First install results in `password authentication failed for user "postgres"`

üö® **IMPORTANT: This solution is ONLY for fresh installations** üö®
If you have an existing Twenty instance with production data, **DO NOT** follow these steps as they will permanently delete your database!

While installing Twenty for the first time, you might want to change the default database password.
The password you set during the first installation becomes permanently stored in the database volume. If you later try to change this password in your configuration without removing the old volume, you'll get authentication errors because the database is still using the original password.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Following steps will PERMANENTLY DELETE all database data! ‚ö†Ô∏è
Only proceed if this is a fresh installation with no important data.

In order to update the `PG_DATABASE_PASSWORD` you need to:
```sh
# Update the PG_DATABASE_PASSWORD in .env
docker compose down --volumes
docker compose up -d
```

#### CR line breaks found [Windows]

This is due to the line break characters of Windows and the git configuration. Try running:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Then delete the repository and clone it again.

#### Missing metadata schema

During Twenty installation, you need to provision your postgres database with the right schemas, extensions, and users.
If you're successful in running this provisioning, you should have `default` and `metadata` schemas in your database.
If you don't, make sure you don't have more than one postgres instance running on your computer.

#### Cannot find module 'twenty-emails' or its corresponding type declarations.

You have to build the package `twenty-emails` before running the initialization of the database with `npx nx run twenty-emails:build`

#### Missing twenty-x package

Make sure to run yarn in the root directory and then run `npx nx server:dev twenty-server`. If this still doesn't work try building the missing package manually.

#### Lint on Save not working

This should work out of the box with the eslint extension installed. If this doesn't work try adding this to your vscode setting (on the dev container scope):

```
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {

  "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"

}
```

#### While running `npx nx start` or `npx nx start twenty-front`, Out of memory error is thrown

In `packages/twenty-front/.env` uncomment `VITE_DISABLE_TYPESCRIPT_CHECKER=true` and `VITE_DISABLE_ESLINT_CHECKER=true` to disable background checks thus reducing amount of needed RAM.

**If it does not work:**  
Run only the services you need, instead of `npx nx start`. For instance, if you work on the server, run only `npx nx worker twenty-server`

**If it does not work:**  
Investigate which processes are taking you most of your machine RAM. At Twenty, we noticed that some VScode extensions were taking a lot of RAM so we temporarily disable them. 

**If it does not work:**  
Restart your machine helps to clean up ghost processes.

#### While running `npx nx start` there are weird [0] and [1] in logs

That's expected as command `npx nx start` is running more commands under the hood

#### No emails are sent
Most of the time, it's because the `worker` is not running in the background. Try to run 
```
npx nx worker twenty-server
```

#### Cannot connect my Microsoft 365 account

Most of the time, it's because your admin has not enabled the Microsoft 365 Licence for your account. Check [https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).  

If you have an error code `AADSTS50020`, it probably means that you are using a personal Microsoft account. This is not supported yet. More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/troubleshoot/entra/entra-id/app-integration/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist) 

#### While running `yarn` warnings appear in console

Warnings are informing about pulling additional dependencies which aren't explicitly stated in `package.json`, so as long as no breaking error appears, everything should work as expected.

#### When user accesses login page, error about unauthorized user trying to access workspace appears in logs

That's expected as user is unauthorized when logged out since its identity is not verified.

#### How to check if your worker is running?
- Go to [webhook-test.com](https://webhook-test.com/) and copy **Your Unique Webhook URL**.
<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/images/docs/developers/self-hosting/webhook-test.jpg" alt="Webhook test" />
</div>
- Open your Twenty app, navigate to `/settings`, and enable the **Advanced** toggle at the bottom left of the screen.
- Create a new webhook.
- Paste **Your Unique Webhook URL** in the **Endpoint Url** field in Twenty. Set the **Filters** to `Companies` and `Created`.
<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/images/docs/developers/self-hosting/webhook-settings.jpg" alt="Webhook settings" />
</div>
- Go to `/objects/companies` and create a new company record.
- Return to [webhook-test.com](https://webhook-test.com/) and check if a new **POST request** has been received.
<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/images/docs/developers/self-hosting/webhook-test-result.jpg" alt="Webhook test result" />
</div>
- If a **POST request** is received, your worker is running successfully. Otherwise, you need to troubleshoot your worker.

### 1-click Docker compose

#### Unable to Log In

If you can't log in after setup:
1. Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it twenty-server-1 yarn
    docker exec -it twenty-server-1 npx nx database:reset  --configuration=no-seed
    ```
2. Restart the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Note the database:reset command will completely erase your database and recreate it from scratch. 

#### Connection Issues Behind a Reverse Proxy

If you're running Twenty behind a reverse proxy and experiencing connection issues:

1. **Verify SERVER_URL:**

    Ensure `SERVER_URL` in your `.env` file matches your external access URL, including `https` if SSL is enabled.

2. **Check Reverse Proxy Settings:**

    - Confirm that your reverse proxy is correctly forwarding requests to the Twenty server.
    - Ensure headers like `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` are properly set.

3. **Restart Services:**

    After making changes, restart both the reverse proxy and Twenty containers.
