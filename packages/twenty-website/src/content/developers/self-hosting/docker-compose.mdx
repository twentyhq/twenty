## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and configure the Twenty application using Docker Compose. The aim is to make the process straightforward and prevent common pitfalls that could break your setup.

**Important:** Only modify settings explicitly mentioned in this guide. Altering other configurations may lead to issues.

See docs [Setup Environment Variables](https://twenty.com/developers/section/self-hosting/setup) for advanced configuration. All environment variables must be declared in the docker-compose.yml file at the server and / or worker level depending on the variable.

## System Requirements

- RAM: Ensure your environment has at least 2GB of RAM. Insufficient memory can cause processes to crash.
- Docker & Docker Compose: Make sure both are installed and up-to-date.

## Option 1: One-line script

Install the latest stable version of Twenty with a single command:
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/scripts/install.sh)
```

To install a specific version or branch:
```bash
VERSION=vx.y.z BRANCH=branch-name bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/scripts/install.sh)
```
- Replace x.y.z with the desired version number.
- Replace branch-name with the name of the branch you want to install.

## Option 2: Manual steps
Follow these steps for a manual setup.

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment File

1. **Create the .env File**

    Copy the example environment file to a new .env file in your working directory:
    ```bash
    curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/refs/heads/main/packages/twenty-docker/.env.example
    ```

2. **Generate Secret Tokens**

    Run the following command to generate a unique random string:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -base64 32
    ```
    **Important:** Keep this value secret / do not share it.

3. **Update the `.env`**

    Replace the placeholder value in your .env file with the generated token:

    ```ini
    APP_SECRET=first_random_string
    ```

4. **Set the Postgres Password**

    Update the `PGPASSWORD_SUPERUSER` value in the .env file with a strong password without special characters.

    ```ini
    PGPASSWORD_SUPERUSER=my_strong_password
    ```

### Step 2: Obtain the Docker Compose File

Download the `docker-compose.yml` file to your working directory:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/refs/heads/main/packages/twenty-docker/docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 3: Launch the Application

Start the Docker containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

### Expose Twenty to External Access

By default, Twenty runs on `localhost` at port `3000`. To access it via an external domain or IP address, you need to configure the `SERVER_URL` in your `.env` file.

#### Understanding `SERVER_URL`

- **Protocol:** Use `http` or `https` depending on your setup.
    - Use `http` if you haven't set up SSL.
    - Use `https` if you have SSL configured.
- **Domain/IP:** This is the domain name or IP address where your application is accessible.
- **Port:** Include the port number if you're not using the default ports (`80` for `http`, `443` for `https`).

### SSL Requirements

SSL (HTTPS) is required for certain browser features to work properly. While these features might work during local development (as browsers treat localhost differently), a proper SSL setup is needed when hosting Twenty on a regular domain.

For example, the clipboard API might require a secure context - some features like copy buttons throughout the application might not work without HTTPS enabled.

We strongly recommend setting up Twenty behind a reverse proxy with SSL termination for optimal security and functionality.

#### Configuring `SERVER_URL`

1. **Determine Your Access URL**
    - **Without Reverse Proxy (Direct Access):**

        If you're accessing the application directly without a reverse proxy:
        ```ini
        SERVER_URL=http://your-domain-or-ip:3000
        ```

    - **With Reverse Proxy (Standard Ports):**

        If you're using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik and have SSL configured:
        ```ini
        SERVER_URL=https://your-domain-or-ip
        ```

    - **With Reverse Proxy (Custom Ports):**

        If you're using non-standard ports:
        ```ini
        SERVER_URL=https://your-domain-or-ip:custom-port
        ````

2. **Update the `.env` File**

    Open your `.env` file and update the `SERVER_URL`:

    ```ini
    SERVER_URL=http(s)://your-domain-or-ip:your-port
    ```

    **Examples:**
    - Direct access without SSL:
        ```ini
        SERVER_URL=http://123.45.67.89:3000
        ```
    - Access via domain with SSL:
        ```ini
        SERVER_URL=https://mytwentyapp.com
        ```

3. **Restart the Application**

    For changes to take effect, restart the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    docker compose up -d
    ```

#### Considerations

- **Reverse Proxy Configuration:**

    Ensure your reverse proxy forwards requests to the correct internal port (`3000` by default). Configure SSL termination and any necessary headers.

- **Firewall Settings:**

    Open necessary ports in your firewall to allow external access.

- **Consistency:**

    The `SERVER_URL` must match how users access your application in their browsers.

#### Persistence

- **Data Volumes:**

    The Docker Compose configuration uses volumes to persist data for the database and server storage.

- **Stateless Environments:**

    If deploying to a stateless environment (e.g., certain cloud services), configure external storage to persist data.
