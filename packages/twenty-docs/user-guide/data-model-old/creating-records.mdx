## About Table Views

Table views are visual representations of data structured in rows and columns.

## Create record

Add records as needed, without limits. To add a record, you can either click on the **+** button at the top right of the screen or at the top of the record **Name** column. 

Enter the record name then press `Enter` to save. To edit a record name, click on its name on its detail page.

**Record Page:** Tap the `⋮` icon in the top right corner, then select delete.
