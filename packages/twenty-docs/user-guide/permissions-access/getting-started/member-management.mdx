## Member Roles

Members can have different roles with varying permissions:

### Admin
- Full access to all settings
- Can manage other members
- Can configure permissions

### Default Roles
Your workspace may have custom roles with specific permissions. Check with your workspace admin for details.

## Best Practices

- **Use appropriate roles**: Assign roles that match each person's responsibilities
- **Regular audits**: Periodically review member access
- **Remove promptly**: Remove access when team members leave
- **Document roles**: Keep track of what each role can do
