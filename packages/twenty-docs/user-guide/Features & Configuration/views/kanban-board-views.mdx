## About Kanban Views

Kanban views visually map out process flows, where each column stands for a distinct stage and each card represents a record.

## Move Cards between Stages

You can move each card between stages as it goes through your workflow by dragging and dropping. To proceed, hold your click on a card and move it to the next stage.

## Add and delete stages

You can tailor your workflow to suit your needs using stages, which represent a value in a Select Field:

### Add Stages

To add a stage, access the Select field settings by navigating to Settings > Data Model, selecting your object, and then the field your Kanban board depends on.

### Remove Stages

To remove a stage, hover the stage name or the `⋮` icon, click `Edit from settings` in the Select field settings, and then click <b>Delete</b> next to the relevant stage.

## Display fields

You can configure your Kanban board to display some fields and hide others. To hide a field, click on <b>Options</b> on the top right, then on <b>Fields</b> to bring up the list of options. Hover the field you want to hide to bring up the `-` button. Click on it to hide the field.

You can also rearrange the order of fields by holding down the field name and dragging it to where you want it.
