## About Custom Domains

Custom domains allow you to access your Twenty workspace through your own domain name, providing a more professional and branded experience.

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

### Prerequisites
- Organization plan or higher
- Access to your domain's DNS settings
- Admin access to your Twenty workspace

### Configuration Steps

1. **Access Domain Settings**
   - Go to **Settings → Domains**
   - Click **Add Custom Domain**

2. **Enter Your Domain**
   - Enter the domain you want to use (e.g., `crm.yourcompany.com`)
   - Click **Verify**

3. **Configure DNS**
   - Add the provided CNAME record to your DNS settings
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

4. **Verify and Activate**
   - Return to Domain Settings
   - Click **Verify** to confirm DNS configuration
   - Enable the custom domain

## SSL Certificates

Twenty automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains:
- Certificates are issued automatically after DNS verification
- Renewal is handled automatically
- HTTPS is enforced for all connections

## Best Practices

### Choosing a Domain
- Use a subdomain (e.g., `crm.company.com`) rather than your root domain
- Choose a memorable, clear name
- Consider your team's needs (internal vs. external access)

### DNS Management
- Keep DNS records documented
- Allow time for propagation before troubleshooting
- Contact your DNS provider if you encounter issues

## Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Verifying
- Ensure CNAME record is correctly configured
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
- Verify there are no conflicting records

### SSL Certificate Issues
- Certificate provisioning can take up to 24 hours
- Ensure no CAA records are blocking certificate issuance
- Contact support if issues persist
