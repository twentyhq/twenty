## About Releases Settings

The Releases section allows you to enable experimental features and beta functionality before they're generally available.

## Lab Features

Lab features are experimental capabilities that are still being developed. They may change or be removed without notice.

### How to Enable Lab Features
1. Go to **Settings → Releases → Lab**
2. Find the feature you want to enable
3. Toggle it on
4. The feature will be available immediately

### Current Lab Features

Features available in Lab may include:
- **Message Folder**: Control which email folders sync with Twenty
- **Iterator**: Loop through arrays in workflows
- Additional experimental features as they're developed

<Warning>
Lab features are experimental and may not work as expected. Use them with caution in production environments.
</Warning>

## Beta Features

Beta features are more stable than Lab features but haven't been fully released yet. They're recommended for users who want early access to new functionality.

### Enabling Beta Features
1. Go to **Settings → Releases**
2. Find the beta feature section
3. Enable the features you want to try

## Feature Feedback

Your feedback helps improve Twenty:
- Report issues with experimental features
- Share how you're using new features
- Suggest improvements via the community Discord

## Best Practices

### Testing New Features
- Enable one feature at a time to isolate issues
- Test in a non-critical workflow first
- Document any unexpected behavior

### Production Use
- Only enable features you need
- Monitor workflows using new features closely
- Have fallback plans for critical processes
