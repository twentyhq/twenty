## Custom Workspace Domain

Set a personalized web address for your workspace:
- Choose your preferred subdomain (e.g., yourcompany.twenty.com)
- Configure custom domains for professional branding

## Approved Access Domains

Allow automatic workspace access for specific email domains.

### How It Works
- Add your company's email domains (e.g., @yourcompany.com)
- Anyone with an email from these domains can automatically join your workspace
- No manual invites needed for team members

### Benefits
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members join automatically
- **Better Security**: Only verified company emails can access
- **Less Admin Work**: No need to manually invite each team member

## Setup Instructions

1. Go to **Settings → Domains**
2. Add your custom domain or approved email domains
3. Verify domain ownership if required

**Note**: Domain changes may take time to take effect and might require verification.
