## Object Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I reorder objects in the left navigation bar?">
Not yet. Object ordering in the navigation is currently fixed, but this feature is planned for a future release.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I hide objects from the left navigation bar?">
All active objects appear in the navigation. You can deactivate objects you don't need under **Settings → Data Model**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I delete standard objects (People, Companies, etc.)?">
You can deactivate any standard objects but you cannot hard delete them.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Field Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I create formula fields?">
Formula fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. In the meantime, you can use workflows to calculate and update field values automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have nested fields in my objects?">
Nested fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. Currently, you can use workflows to bring field values from related objects. For example, to display a company's industry on a Person record, create a custom field on People and use a workflow to synchronize the value.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I update relation field names?">
Relation field names impact the API structure and cannot be changed after creation. If you need to rename a relation field, you'll need to create a new one and delete the old one.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I need different singular and plural names?">
Our GraphQL API uses both forms for different operations:
- `createPerson` (singular) for single record actions
- `createPeople` (plural) for bulk operations

This creates limitations when singular and plural forms are the same, but it improves the developer experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are some field names protected?">
Certain field names like `Type` or `Application` are reserved for system use. Choose alternative names like `Category` or `Classification` instead.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Features

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I create many-to-many relationships?">
Many-to-many relationships are coming in **Q1 2026**. Currently, create an intermediate object with two 1-to-many relationships as a workaround.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Morph Many relationships?">
Morph Many relationships allow one object to relate to multiple different object types through a single field. For example, an Opportunity can relate to either a Person or a Company. This feature is now available - learn more in our [Relation Fields](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/admins/data-model/how-to-create-relation-fields#morph-many-relationships) documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I reorder fields in objects?">
Field reordering will be available with custom layouts in **Q4 2025**. Currently, fields appear in the alphabetical order.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Access and Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Where can I see and edit my data model?">
You can access your Data Model under **Settings → Data Model**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I see the Data Model under Settings?">
Reach out to your workspace administrator. Data model access is usually restricted to administrators only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many custom objects or fields can I create?">
You can create as many custom objects and fields as you need - the price won't change.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Data Model Questions

### Can I delete a custom object?
No, you cannot delete custom objects once created. This is by design to prevent accidental data loss. However, you can **deactivate** custom objects, which hides them from your workspace while preserving all data.

To deactivate an object:
1. Go to Settings → Data Model
2. Find your custom object
3. Toggle it to "Inactive"

### Can I delete a custom field?
Similar to objects, you cannot delete custom fields once created. You can **deactivate** them instead:
1. Go to Settings → Data Model → [Object Name]
2. Find the field you want to hide
3. Toggle it to "Inactive"

The field will be hidden from views and forms, but all data remains intact.

### Can I edit field names after creation?
**Standard fields**: You can edit the display name but not the API name.
**Custom fields**: You cannot edit field names once created, as this would break API integrations and existing data references.

**Workaround**: Create a new field with the correct name, migrate data manually, then deactivate the old field.

### Why can't I delete standard fields?
Standard fields (like Name, Email, Created At) are core to Twenty's functionality. Many features depend on these fields existing. You can deactivate standard fields you don't need, but they cannot be deleted.

### How many custom fields can I create?
There's no hard limit on custom fields per object. However, consider:
- **Performance**: Too many fields can slow down views
- **Usability**: Users get overwhelmed with too many fields
- **Best practice**: Use 10-20 fields per object for optimal experience

### Can I change a field type after creation?
Field types cannot be changed after creation. This prevents data corruption and maintains API consistency.

**Workaround**: Create a new field with the correct type, migrate data, then deactivate the old field.

### What happens to data when I deactivate a field?
- **Data is preserved**: All existing data remains in the database
- **Hidden from UI**: The field won't appear in forms or views
- **API access**: The field is still accessible via API
- **Reactivation**: You can reactivate the field anytime to restore visibility

### Can I create relationships between any objects?
Yes, you can create relationships between:
- Standard objects (People, Companies, Opportunities)
- Custom objects you've created
- Workspace Members (for ownership/assignment fields)

### Why can't I create many-to-many relationships?
Many-to-many relationships are not yet supported but are planned for Q1 2026. Currently, you can only create one-to-many relationships.

**Workaround**: Create a "junction" object that links to both objects you want to connect.

### Can I import data with relationships?
Yes, when importing CSV files, you can include relationship data by referencing unique fields:
- **People → Company**: Include company domain in people CSV
- **Opportunities → Person**: Include person email in opportunities CSV
- **Custom relationships**: Use any unique field from the target object

### What's the difference between deactivating and deleting?
**Deactivating** (Available):
- Hides the field/object from UI
- Preserves all data
- Can be reversed anytime
- Maintains API structure

**Deleting** (Not available):
- Would permanently remove data
- Cannot be reversed
- Would break existing integrations

### How do I organize many custom fields?
**Use Views**: Create different views showing only relevant fields for specific use cases.

**Field Groups**: Organize related fields together in your data model.

**Descriptions**: Add clear descriptions to help users understand field purposes.

**Naming Convention**: Use consistent prefixes or suffixes for related fields.

### Can I set default values for custom fields?
Yes, when creating custom fields, you can set default values that will be automatically applied to new records.

### Why do some fields show "Required" and others don't?
**System requirements**: Some fields like Email (for People) are required by Twenty's core functionality.

**Custom requirements**: You can mark your custom fields as required during creation.

**Business logic**: Required fields ensure data quality and prevent incomplete records.

### Can I create calculated/formula fields?
Formula fields are available for creating calculated values based on other fields. This feature allows you to:
- Perform mathematical calculations
- Concatenate text fields
- Create conditional logic
- Reference related object data

### How do I handle field validation?
You can set up validation rules for custom fields:
- **Format validation**: Email format, phone number format, etc.
- **Range validation**: Minimum/maximum values for numbers
- **Length validation**: Character limits for text fields
- **Custom patterns**: Regular expressions for specific formats

### What happens when I reach field limits?
While there's no hard limit, if you experience performance issues:
- **Review field usage**: Deactivate unused fields
- **Optimize views**: Show only necessary fields in each view
- **Consider object design**: Split complex objects into multiple simpler ones

### Can I bulk update field properties?
Currently, field properties must be updated individually. For bulk changes:
- Plan your data model carefully upfront
- Use consistent naming and configuration patterns
- Consider using the API for programmatic updates
