Login and authentication problems can prevent you from accessing your Twenty workspace. This guide covers the most common issues and their solutions to get you back up and running quickly.

## Common Login Problems

**Problem**: "Workspace not found" or "Invalid workspace URL"

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect workspace URL or subdomain
- Workspace has been deleted or suspended

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify the workspace URL**: Check that you're using the correct subdomain (e.g., `yourcompany.twenty.com`)
2. **Check with your administrator**: Confirm the workspace is still active
3. **Clear browser cache**: Clear cookies and cached data for the Twenty domain
4. **Try incognito mode**: Test login in a private/incognito browser window
5. **Contact support**: If the workspace should exist but you can't access it

### Email/Password Login Issues

**Problem**: "Invalid email or password" error

**Possible Causes**:

**Solutions**:
1. **Double-check credentials**: Verify email address spelling and password
2. **Use password reset**: Click "Forgot Password?" to reset your password
3. **Check email invitations**: Look for workspace invitation emails
4. **Contact workspace admin**: Verify your account exists and is active
5. **Try different email**: You might have multiple email addresses

### Password Reset Problems

**Problem**: Not receiving password reset emails

**Possible Causes**:

**Solutions**:
1. **Check spam folder**: Look in junk/spam folders for the reset email
2. **Wait and retry**: Email delivery can take a few minutes

5. **Contact support**: If emails consistently don't arrive

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

### Cannot Access 2FA Code

**Problem**: Lost access to 2FA device or app

**Possible Causes**:
- Lost or broken phone/device
