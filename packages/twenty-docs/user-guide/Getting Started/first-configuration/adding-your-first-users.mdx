Getting your team set up in Twenty is straightforward. You can invite colleagues, assign appropriate permissions, and have everyone collaborating in minutes.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have admin permissions in your workspace. Only workspace administrators can invite new users and manage permissions.

## Inviting Team Members

### Step 1: Access User Management
1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Navigate to **Members** under the Workspace section
3. You'll see a list of current workspace members

### Step 2: Send Invitations
1. Click **+ Invite** at the top right
2. Enter the email addresses of people you want to invite
3. You can add multiple emails separated by commas
4. Choose the role you want to assign them
5. Click **Send Invitations**

### Step 3: Track Invitation Status
Invited users will appear in your member list with a "Pending" status until they accept the invitation and create their account.

## Understanding User Roles

### Admin Role
**Full access** to everything in the workspace:
- Can invite and remove users
- Access to all workspace settings
- Can modify data model and integrations
- Full access to all objects and records
- Can manage billing and subscription

**Best for**: Workspace owners, IT administrators, CRM managers

### Member Role
**Standard user access** with configurable permissions:
- Can create, edit, and delete records (based on object permissions)
- Access to assigned objects and views
- Can create personal views and workflows
- Cannot modify workspace settings or invite users

**Best for**: Sales reps, customer success managers, regular team members

### Viewer Role
**Read-only access** to permitted data:
- Can view records but cannot edit or delete
- Cannot create new records
- Can access reports and dashboards
- Cannot modify any settings

**Best for**: Executives, external stakeholders, reporting users

## Setting Up Object Permissions

After inviting users, configure what data they can access:

### Step 1: Access Object Settings
1. Go to **Settings** → **Data Model**
2. Select the object you want to configure
3. Click on the **Permissions** tab

### Step 2: Configure Access Levels
For each role, set permissions:
- **Read**: Can view records
- **Create**: Can add new records
- **Update**: Can edit existing records
- **Delete**: Can remove records

### Common Permission Patterns

**Sales Team Setup**:
- People: Full access (manage contacts)
- Companies: Full access (account management)
- Opportunities: Full access (sales pipeline)
- Tasks: Full access (activity tracking)

**Marketing Team Setup**:
- People: Read, Create, Update (lead management)
- Companies: Read, Create, Update (prospect research)
- Opportunities: Read only (pipeline visibility)
- Tasks: Full access (campaign activities)

**Executive Team Setup**:
- All objects: Read only (reporting and oversight)
- Custom reporting objects: Full access if needed

## Onboarding New Team Members

### Welcome Email
When users accept their invitation, they'll receive a welcome email with:
- Link to access the workspace
- Basic getting started information
- Contact information for support

### First Login Setup
New users will need to:
1. Create their password
2. Complete their profile information
3. Set their timezone and preferences
4. Take a quick tour of the interface

### Providing Initial Training

**Show them the basics**:
- How to navigate the interface
- Where to find their assigned objects
- How to create and edit records
- Basic search and filtering

**Share important views**:
- Create shared views for common tasks
- Show them how to create personal views
- Explain any custom fields or processes

**Set expectations**:
- Data entry standards and requirements
- Team workflows and processes
- Who to contact for help or questions

## Managing User Access

### Updating Roles
To change a user's role:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Members**
2. Find the user in the list
3. Click on their current role
4. Select the new role from the dropdown
5. Changes take effect immediately

### Removing Users
To remove someone from your workspace:
1. Find the user in the member list
2. Click the three dots next to their name
3. Select **Remove from workspace**
4. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
Removing a user will unassign them from all records and tasks. Make sure to reassign their work before removing them.
</Warning>

### Deactivating vs. Removing
**Deactivating** (if available): Keeps the user's data and history but prevents login
**Removing**: Completely removes the user from the workspace

## User Management Best Practices

### Start with Minimal Access
- Begin with the most restrictive permissions needed
- Add access as users demonstrate they need it
- Regular review permissions quarterly

### Use Consistent Role Assignments
- Create standard role templates for different job functions
- Document what permissions each role should have
- Train managers on appropriate role assignments

### Monitor User Activity
- Review who's actively using the system
- Identify users who might need additional training
- Remove access for users who no longer need it

### Plan for User Growth
- Consider how permissions will scale as you add more users
- Think about department-based access patterns
- Plan for seasonal or temporary users

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Invitation Not Received
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify the email address is correct
- Resend the invitation if needed
- Contact the user directly with workspace information

### User Can't Access Expected Data
- Verify their role has appropriate object permissions
- Check if specific records are restricted
- Ensure they're looking in the right views
- Review any custom permission settings

### Permission Changes Not Taking Effect
- Ask the user to refresh their browser
- Check if they need to log out and back in
- Verify the permission change was saved correctly
- Allow a few minutes for changes to propagate
