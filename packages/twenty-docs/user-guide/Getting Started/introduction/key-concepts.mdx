## Understanding Twenty's Building Blocks

Twenty CRM is built around four core concepts that work together to organize and manage your business data. Understanding these concepts will help you make the most of the platform.

## Objects: Your Data Structure

Objects are the foundation of your CRM. Think of them as categories or types of information you want to track.

### Standard Objects
Twenty comes with pre-built objects for common business needs:

**People**: Individual contacts like customers, prospects, or team members
**Companies**: Organizations you work with or want to target
**Opportunities**: Potential deals or sales in your pipeline
**Tasks**: Action items and to-dos for your team
**Notes**: Important information and observations

### Custom Objects
You can create your own objects to track anything specific to your business:
- Projects
- Support Tickets
- Products
- Events
- Invoices

Each object contains fields that define what information you can store about that type of record.

## Records: Your Actual Data

Records are individual entries within an object. They represent the actual people, companies, deals, or other items you're tracking.

### Examples of Records
- In your People object: "Sarah Johnson", "Mike Chen", "Alex Rodriguez"
- In your Companies object: "Acme Corp", "TechStart Inc", "Global Solutions"
- In your Opportunities object: "Q4 Enterprise Deal", "Website Redesign Project"

Each record contains the specific information (field values) for that individual item.

## Fields: Record Properties

Fields define what information you can store about each record. They're like columns in a spreadsheet.

### Common Field Types
**Text Fields**: Names, descriptions, notes
**Email Fields**: Contact email addresses
**Phone Fields**: Phone numbers with country codes
**Number Fields**: Amounts, quantities, scores
**Date Fields**: Deadlines, meeting dates, birthdays
**Select Fields**: Dropdown options like status or priority
**Relation Fields**: Connections between different objects

### Field Relationships
Fields can connect records from different objects. For example:
- A Person record can be linked to a Company record
- An Opportunity can be connected to both a Person and Company
- Tasks can be associated with any other record type

## Views: Different Perspectives

Views let you see and organize your data in different ways. Each view can show different fields, apply filters, and use different layouts.

### View Types

**Table View**: Spreadsheet-like rows and columns, perfect for detailed data entry and bulk editing

**Kanban View**: Card-based boards that show records moving through stages, ideal for sales pipelines and project management

**Calendar View**: Time-based display for records with dates, great for scheduling and deadline tracking

### View Customization
For each view, you can:
- Choose which fields to display
- Set filters to show only relevant records
- Apply sorting to organize information
- Save different configurations for different purposes

## Pipelines: Process Visualization

Pipelines are specialized kanban views that represent your business processes. They show how records move through different stages.

### Common Pipeline Uses
**Sales Pipeline**: Track opportunities from initial contact to closed deal
**Support Pipeline**: Move tickets from new to resolved
**Hiring Pipeline**: Manage candidates through your recruitment process
**Project Pipeline**: Track projects from planning to completion

### Pipeline Stages
Each pipeline consists of stages that represent steps in your process:
- Sales: Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won/Lost
- Support: New → In Progress → Waiting → Resolved → Closed

## How They Work Together

These concepts combine to create a powerful system:

1. **Objects** define what types of things you track
2. **Fields** define what information you store about each thing
3. **Records** are the actual items you're managing
4. **Views** let you see and work with your records in different ways
5. **Pipelines** help you visualize and manage your processes

### Example Workflow
1. Create a Companies object with fields for name, industry, and size
2. Add Company records for your prospects and customers
3. Create a People object with fields for name, email, and role
4. Link People records to their respective Companies
5. Set up different views to see all contacts, just decision makers, or companies by industry
6. Use a sales pipeline to track opportunities through your sales process
