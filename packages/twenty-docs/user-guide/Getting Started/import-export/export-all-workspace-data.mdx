## Export Data

You can download data from most of your objects and up to 20,000 records per export.
To export data from an object:

1. Visit the object index.
2. Choose the view for data export. Configure the columns you want to download by hiding or adding columns and find the records you need by filtering your view.
3. Access the side panel through the `⋮` icon on the top right.
4. Click on `Export view`.
5. Select the save location for the CSV data. Note that exporting may take time with a large record count.

## Export Best Practices

### Preparing Your Export
- **Choose the right view**: Set up your view with only the columns you need
- **Apply filters**: Export only the records you actually need
- **Check record count**: Remember the 20,000 record limit per export

### Large Data Sets
If you have more than 20,000 records:
- **Use filters**: Break down exports by date ranges, categories, or other criteria
- **Multiple exports**: Export in batches and combine later
- **Contact support**: For very large datasets, reach out for assistance

### Data Format
- **CSV format**: All exports are in CSV format
- **Column headers**: Include field names for easy identification
- **Date formats**: Dates export in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

## What Gets Exported

### Standard Fields
All visible standard fields in your view will be included in the export.

### Custom Fields
Any custom fields you've added and made visible in the view will be exported.

### Relationships
Related object information is included where applicable:
- People exports include linked company information
- Opportunities include associated company and person details

## Next Steps

After exporting your data:
- **Backup regularly**: Set up a routine for regular data exports
- **Analyze externally**: Use the CSV in Excel, Google Sheets, or other tools
- **Migration planning**: Use exports when planning migrations to other systems
