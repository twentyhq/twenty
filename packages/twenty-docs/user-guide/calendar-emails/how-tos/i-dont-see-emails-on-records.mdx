title: I Don't See Emails on Records
description: Troubleshooting missing emails on records.

## Common Reasons

### 1. Initial Sync Still in Progress
Email sync takes time, especially for large mailboxes. Twenty imports emails at approximately **400 messages per minute** (limited by Gmail API rate limiting).

- **Calendar sync**: Completes in minutes
- **Email sync**: Depends on mailbox size (e.g., 10,000 emails ≈ 25 minutes, 50,000 emails ≈ 2 hours)

**Solution**: Wait for the initial import to complete. You can estimate timing based on your mailbox size.

### 2. Contact Doesn't Exist in Twenty
Emails only appear on existing People records. If the contact wasn't created yet:
- Enable **Contact Auto-Creation** in your mailbox settings
- Or manually create the Person record first

**Solution**: Go to **Settings → Accounts**, select your mailbox, and enable contact auto-creation.

### 3. Internal Emails Are Excluded
Emails between colleagues (same email domain) are never synced to maintain privacy.

**Solution**: This is expected behavior. Only external emails are synced.

### 4. Email Is from a Group or Distribution List
Group emails and distribution lists are excluded from sync.

**Solution**: This is expected behavior.

### 5. Folder Not Selected for Sync
If you're using the Message Folder feature, some folders might be excluded.

**Solution**: Go to **Settings → Accounts**, select your mailbox, and check folder sync settings.

### 6. Wrong Email Address on Record
The Person record might have a different email address than the one used in the email.

**Solution**: Add the correct email address to the Person record.

## Still Not Working?

1. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your mailbox
2. Contact support if issues persist
