title: Can I Send Emails from Twenty?
description: Information about sending emails directly from Twenty.

## Current Status

At the moment, Twenty's email integration is designed to **sync and display** your email history. When you hit `Reply` at the bottom of a thread, you will be redirected directly in the relevant thread, in your mailbox. This is where you will be able to edit and send your message.
Sending emails from Twenty will be available later in 2026.

If you need to have emails automatically be sent based on automations, you can configure this using workflows. Please see [here](/user-guide/workflows/how-tos/how-to-send-emails-from-workflows) how to set it up.

If you need to send newsletters or sequences, it is recommended to set up a workfow to connect Twenty to a dedicated tool. Mass emails should not be sent from your mailbox to protect your domain reputation.

## What You Can Do

- **View email history** on People, Companies, and Opportunities records
- **Read full email threads** with contacts in your CRM
- **Track communication context** alongside calendar events
- **Auto-create contacts** from email interactions

## How to Send Emails

1. Use your native email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
2. Send the email as you normally would
3. The email will automatically sync to Twenty within 5 minutes
4. View the email thread on the relevant CRM records

## Future Plans

Email composition from within Twenty is on our roadmap. Join our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/discussions) to share your use case and help prioritize this feature.
