## Overview

Twenty supports **unlimited email accounts per user**. This is useful if you manage multiple inboxes, such as:
- Personal work email + shared team inbox
- Multiple client-facing email addresses
- Different email accounts for different roles

## How to Add Multiple Mailboxes

1. Go to **Settings → Accounts**
2. Click **Add account**
3. Connect your additional Google or Microsoft account
4. Configure sync settings for this mailbox
5. Repeat for each mailbox you want to connect

## Managing Multiple Accounts

Each connected mailbox has its own settings:
- **Email visibility**: Choose what teammates can see
- **Contact auto-creation**: Enable/disable per mailbox
- **Folder selection**: Choose which folders to sync (Lab feature)

## How Emails Appear

Emails from all your connected mailboxes are synced to Twenty and appear on:
- **People records**: Based on the contact's email address
- **Company records**: Based on the email domain
- **Opportunities**: Based on the linked company

<Note>Each email shows which mailbox it was sent from/received to, so you can track which account was used for each communication.</Note>

## Important Notes

<Warning>Only true mailboxes can be connected. Email aliases that forward to another mailbox cannot be connected separately—they'll sync through the main mailbox.</Warning>
