title: Limit Emails Imported
description: Control which emails are imported into Twenty.
---

## Overview

By default, Twenty syncs all external emails from your connected mailbox. You can limit what gets imported using **folder selection** and **visibility settings**.

## Method 1: Folder Selection (Recommended)

Control which email folders sync with Twenty:

1. Go to **Settings → Releases → Lab**
2. Enable **Message Folder**
3. Return to **Settings → Accounts**
4. Select your connected email account
5. Choose which folders to sync:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Inbox** | Primary incoming emails |
| **Sent** | Outgoing emails you've sent |
| **Archive** | Archived messages |
| **Custom Folders** | Any specific folders you want |

6. Exclude folders you don't want synced (Spam, Trash, personal folders)

<Note>This gives you precise control over which emails appear in your CRM without syncing everything.</Note>

## Method 2: Contact Auto-Creation Settings

Control when contacts are created from emails:

1. Go to **Settings → Accounts**
2. Select your connected mailbox
3. Choose an option:
   - **Deactivated**: No contacts created, but emails still sync to existing contacts
   - **Sent & Received**: Create contacts from all external emails
   - **Sent Only**: Only create contacts from emails you send

## What's Always Excluded

These emails are never synced, regardless of settings:

- **Internal emails**: Messages between colleagues (same domain)
- **Group emails**: Distribution lists and group messages
- **Spam/Trash**: System folders are typically excluded

## Important Note

<Note>We don't provide a CC email address for selective syncing. Use the folder selection feature above to achieve the same level of control.</Note>
