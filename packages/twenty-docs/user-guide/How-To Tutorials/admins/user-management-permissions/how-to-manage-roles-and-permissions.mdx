Twenty's permission system allows you to control access to three main areas:
- **Objects and Fields**: Control who can view, edit, or delete records and individual fields
- **Settings**: Manage access to workspace configuration and administrative functions
- **Actions**: Control general workspace actions like importing data or sending emails

## Create a Role

To create a new role:

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Under **All Roles**, click on **+ Create Role**
3. Enter a role name
4. In the default **Permissions** tab, configure permissions
5. Click **Save** to finish

## Delete a Role

To delete a role:

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Click on the role you want to remove
3. Open the **Settings** tab, then click **Delete Role**
4. Click **Confirm** in the modal

Note: If a role is deleted, any workspace member assigned to it will be automatically reassigned to the default role. All except the **Admin** role can be deleted. There must always be at least one member assigned to the **Admin** role.

## Assign Roles to Members

### View Current Assignments
- Go to **Settings → Roles**
- See all roles and how many members are assigned to each
- View which members have which roles

### Assign a Role to a Member
1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Click on the role you want to assign
3. Open the **Assignment** tab
4. Click **+ Assign to member**
5. Select the workspace member from the list
6. Confirm the assignment

## Configuring Object Permissions

### Setting Object Access
Control which objects users can access:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Data Model**
2. Select the object you want to configure
3. Click on **Permissions** tab
4. Set permissions for each role:
   - **Admin**: Typically has full access
   - **Member**: Configure based on business needs
   - **Viewer**: Usually read-only or no access

### Permission Combinations
You can create different permission combinations:
- **Full Access**: Read, Create, Update, Delete
- **Editor**: Read, Create, Update (no delete)
- **Creator**: Read, Create (no edit or delete)
- **Read-Only**: Read only
- **No Access**: Object is hidden from user

### Example Permission Configurations

**Sales Team Setup**:
- **People**: Full access (sales reps manage contacts)
- **Companies**: Full access (account management)
- **Opportunities**: Full access (sales pipeline)
- **Tasks**: Full access (activity management)
- **Workflows**: Read-only (can see but not modify automations)

**Marketing Team Setup**:
- **People**: Read, Create, Update (lead management)
- **Companies**: Read, Create, Update (account research)
- **Opportunities**: Read-only (pipeline visibility)
- **Tasks**: Full access (campaign tasks)
- **Workflows**: Read-only (automation visibility)

**Executive Team Setup**:
- **All Objects**: Read-only (dashboard and reporting access)
- **Reports**: Full access (analytics and insights)
- **Workflows**: Read-only (process visibility)

## Advanced Permission Scenarios

### Department-Based Permissions
Create role-based access for different departments:

**HR Department**:
- **People**: Full access for employee records
- **Companies**: Read-only for organizational context
- **Opportunities**: No access (not relevant to HR)
- **Custom HR Objects**: Full access

**Finance Department**:
- **Companies**: Read access for billing information
- **Opportunities**: Read access for revenue forecasting
- **People**: Limited access for contact information
- **Custom Finance Objects**: Full access

### Project-Based Access
Configure permissions for project teams:
- **Project Managers**: Full access to project-related objects
- **Team Members**: Edit access to assigned tasks and activities
- **Stakeholders**: Read-only access to project status and reports
- **External Partners**: Limited read access to relevant project data

### Temporary Access Management
Handle temporary or contractor access:
- **Consultants**: Time-limited access to specific objects
- **Auditors**: Read-only access to all relevant data
- **Temporary Staff**: Limited permissions that can be easily revoked
- **Vendors**: Access only to objects relevant to their work

## Permission Best Practices

### Security Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give users only the minimum access needed
- **Regular Reviews**: Audit permissions quarterly to ensure they're still appropriate
- **Role-Based Access**: Use roles rather than individual permissions when possible
- **Documentation**: Document why specific permissions are granted

### Implementation Strategy
- **Start Restrictive**: Begin with minimal permissions and add as needed
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify permissions work as expected before rolling out
- **User Training**: Ensure users understand their access levels and limitations
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather user feedback on permission effectiveness

### Common Patterns
- **Hierarchical Access**: Managers have broader access than team members
- **Departmental Boundaries**: Limit cross-department data access
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Restrict access to confidential information
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of permission changes

## Troubleshooting Permissions

### Common Permission Issues

**User Can't See Expected Data**:
- Check object-level permissions for their role
- Verify the user is assigned to the correct role
- Ensure the object isn't deactivated
- Check for view-level filters that might hide data

**User Can't Perform Expected Actions**:
- Verify they have the required permission level (Create, Update, Delete)
- Check if the specific field has restrictions
- Ensure they have access to related objects needed for the action
- Verify workspace-level permissions aren't blocking the action

**Permission Changes Not Taking Effect**:
- Ask user to refresh their browser or log out/in
- Check if there are conflicting permission settings
- Verify the permission change was saved correctly
- Allow time for permission changes to propagate

### Permission Conflicts
When permissions conflict:
- **Most Restrictive Wins**: The most limiting permission takes precedence
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Directly assigned permissions override inherited ones
- **Role Hierarchy**: Higher-level roles can override lower-level restrictions
- **Object vs. Field**: Field-level restrictions can override object permissions

## Monitoring and Auditing Permissions

### Permission Auditing
Regularly review and audit permissions:
- **User Access Reviews**: Quarterly review of who has access to what
- **Permission Reports**: Generate reports showing current permission assignments
- **Access Logs**: Monitor who accesses sensitive data and when
- **Change Tracking**: Keep records of permission modifications

### Compliance Considerations
Ensure permissions meet regulatory requirements:
- **Data Privacy**: Restrict access to personal information as required by GDPR/CCPA
- **Financial Data**: Limit access to financial information per SOX requirements
- **Healthcare**: Ensure HIPAA compliance for medical information
- **Industry Standards**: Meet industry-specific access control requirements

## Advanced Permission Features

### Custom Roles (Coming Soon)
Create workspace-specific roles:
- **Role Templates**: Save common permission combinations
- **Inheritance**: Base new roles on existing ones
- **Conditional Permissions**: Permissions that change based on data values
- **Time-Based Access**: Permissions that expire automatically

### Dynamic Permissions (Roadmap)
Future permission enhancements:
- **Record-Level Permissions**: Control access to individual records
- **Conditional Access**: Permissions based on field values or relationships
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Location-based access controls
- **Time-Based Permissions**: Access that varies by time of day or date

## Integration with Other Features

### Permissions and Workflows
How permissions interact with automation:
- **Workflow Execution**: Workflows run with admin permissions by default
- **User-Triggered Actions**: Respect the triggering user's permissions
- **Notification Permissions**: Only send notifications to users with appropriate access
- **Data Modification**: Workflows can modify data users can't directly access

### Permissions and API Access
API access respects user permissions:
- **API Keys**: Inherit permissions from the user who created them
- **Webhook Permissions**: Respect object and field permissions
- **Data Export**: Only export data the user has permission to see
- **Integration Access**: Third-party integrations limited by user permissions
