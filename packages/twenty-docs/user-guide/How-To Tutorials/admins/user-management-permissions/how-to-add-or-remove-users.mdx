## Adding New Users

- Decide on appropriate roles and permissions
- Plan onboarding and training for new users

**Consider security**:
- Ensure new users should have access to your workspace data
- Review your organization's access policies
- Plan for proper offboarding when users eventually leave

### Step-by-Step: Inviting New Users

2. Under the "Workspace" section, click **Members**
3. You'll see a list of current workspace members and their roles

#### Step 3: Invitation Process
- An invitation email is sent to the specified address
- The recipient must click the link in the email to accept
- They'll be prompted to create a password and complete their profile
- Once accepted, they'll appear in your members list

### Bulk User Invitations

**For multiple users**:
1. Repeat the invitation process for each user
2. Consider using a spreadsheet to track invitations sent
3. Follow up with users who haven't accepted invitations
4. Set a reasonable deadline for accepting invitations

**Managing invitation status**:
- Track which invitations are pending
- Resend invitations if needed
- Cancel invitations that are no longer needed
- Monitor for bounced or undelivered invitation emails

## Managing Existing Users

### Viewing User Information

**Member list overview**:
- See all workspace members at a glance
- View each user's role and status
- Check when users last accessed the workspace
- Monitor user activity and engagement

**Individual user details**:
1. Click on any user's name in the members list
2. View their profile information and settings
3. See their role assignments and permissions
4. Check their activity history and last login

### Updating User Roles

**Changing a user's role**:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Members**
2. Click on the user whose role you want to change
3. Select a new role from the dropdown menu
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes
5. The user's permissions update immediately

**Role considerations**:
- Ensure users have appropriate access for their responsibilities
- Avoid giving users more permissions than necessary
- Consider creating custom roles for specific needs
- Document role assignments for audit purposes

### Modifying User Status

**Active vs. Inactive users**:
- **Active**: Can log in and access the workspace
- **Inactive**: Cannot log in but data remains
- Use inactive status for temporary access suspension
- Inactive users don't count against your plan limits

**Changing user status**:
1. Open the user's profile from the members list
2. Toggle their active/inactive status
3. Confirm the change when prompted
4. Inactive users can be reactivated at any time

## Removing Users

### When to Remove Users

**Appropriate situations**:
- Employee leaves the organization
- Contractor completes their project
- User no longer needs CRM access
- Security concerns require immediate access removal
- Reducing workspace costs by removing unused accounts

**Before removing users**:
- Ensure they don't own critical records or workflows
- Transfer ownership of important data to other users
- Back up any unique information they may have created
- Communicate with team members who work with this user

### Step-by-Step: User Removal

#### Step 1: Prepare for Removal
1. **Transfer record ownership**: Reassign any records owned by the departing user
2. **Update workflows**: Modify any workflows that assign tasks to this user
3. **Review integrations**: Check if the user is connected to any external services
4. **Backup data**: Export any unique data or configurations they created

#### Step 2: Remove the User
1. Go to **Settings** → **Members**
2. Find the user you want to remove
3. Click on their name to open their profile
4. Click the **Remove User** or **Delete** button
5. Confirm the removal when prompted

<Warning>
Removing a user is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you've transferred all important data before proceeding.
</Warning>

#### Step 3: Post-Removal Cleanup
1. **Verify data integrity**: Check that all important records are still accessible
2. **Update team communications**: Inform relevant team members about the change
3. **Review access logs**: Ensure the user can no longer access the workspace
4. **Update documentation**: Remove the user from any team directories or contact lists

### Handling User Data After Removal

**What happens to their data**:
- Records they created remain in the system
- Ownership may transfer to a default user or admin
- Their name may still appear in activity histories
- Comments and notes they made are preserved

**Data reassignment**:
- Manually reassign important records before removal
- Update ownership of custom fields or objects they created
- Transfer any personal views or configurations to other users
- Ensure continuity of business processes
