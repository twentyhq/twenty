Data validation rules are your first line of defense against poor data quality. By setting up proper validation, you can prevent common data entry errors, ensure consistency across your workspace, and maintain the integrity of your CRM data.

## Understanding Data Validation

### What Are Validation Rules?
Validation rules are constraints that check data before it's saved to your database. They ensure that information meets specific criteria, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from entering your system.

### Benefits of Validation Rules
- **Prevent data entry errors** before they happen
- **Ensure consistency** across all user inputs
- **Maintain data integrity** for reliable reporting
- **Reduce cleanup time** by catching issues early
- **Improve user experience** with clear error messages

### Types of Validation
- **Format validation**: Ensure data follows specific patterns
- **Range validation**: Check that numbers fall within acceptable ranges
- **Required field validation**: Ensure critical fields aren't left empty
- **Uniqueness validation**: Prevent duplicate entries
- **Cross-field validation**: Verify relationships between fields

## Field-Level Validation Rules

### Text Field Validation

**Format requirements**:
- **Pattern matching**: Ensure text follows specific formats
- **Length limits**: Set minimum and maximum character counts
- **Character restrictions**: Allow only certain types of characters
- **Case requirements**: Enforce uppercase, lowercase, or title case

**Common examples**:
```
Phone Number: Must match format (XXX) XXX-XXXX
Product Code: Must be 6 characters, alphanumeric only
Department: Must be one of: Sales, Marketing, Support, Engineering
```

**Implementation**:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Data Model** → **[Object]** → **Fields**
2. Select the text field you want to validate
3. Add validation rules in the field configuration
4. Set error messages for validation failures

### Number Field Validation

**Range validation**:
- **Minimum values**: Prevent negative numbers where inappropriate
- **Maximum values**: Set realistic upper limits
- **Decimal precision**: Control number of decimal places
- **Step validation**: Ensure numbers increment by specific amounts

**Business examples**:
```
Deal Amount: Must be greater than $0, maximum $10,000,000
Discount Percentage: Must be between 0 and 50
Employee Count: Must be positive integer, maximum 1,000,000
Probability: Must be between 0 and 100
```

### Date Field Validation

**Date range validation**:
- **Future dates only**: For deadlines and scheduled events
- **Past dates only**: For historical records
- **Business day validation**: Exclude weekends and holidays
- **Relative date validation**: Must be within X days of today

**Common scenarios**:
```
Close Date: Must be in the future
Birth Date: Must be in the past, not more than 120 years ago
Contract End Date: Must be after Contract Start Date
Follow-up Date: Must be within 90 days of today
```

### Email Field Validation

**Email format validation**:
- **Standard format checking**: Ensure valid email structure
- **Domain restrictions**: Allow only specific domains
- **Blacklist domains**: Prevent certain domains
- **Uniqueness requirements**: Ensure no duplicate emails

**Examples**:
```
Work Email: Must be valid format, cannot be personal domains
Primary Contact: Must be unique across all People records
Support Email: Must end with company domain
```

## Object-Level Validation Rules

### Cross-Field Validation

**Relationship validation**:
- **Date relationships**: End date must be after start date
- **Numeric relationships**: Actual must not exceed budget
- **Conditional requirements**: If field A is filled, field B is required
- **Mutual exclusivity**: Only one of several fields can be filled

**Implementation examples**:
```
IF Contract Type = "Annual" THEN Contract End Date must be exactly 1 year after Start Date
IF Deal Stage = "Closed Won" THEN Close Date is required
IF Discount > 0 THEN Discount Reason is required
Budget Amount must be greater than or equal to Actual Amount
```

### Conditional Validation

**Context-dependent rules**:
- **Industry-specific requirements**: Different rules for different industries
- **Role-based validation**: Different requirements based on user roles
- **Stage-dependent validation**: Rules that change based on record status
- **Size-based validation**: Different rules for different company sizes

**Business scenarios**:
```
IF Company Industry = "Healthcare" THEN Compliance Officer is required
IF Deal Amount > $50,000 THEN Manager Approval is required
IF Lead Source = "Trade Show" THEN Event Name is required
IF Company Type = "Enterprise" THEN Account Manager is required
```

## Setting Up Validation Rules

### Step 1: Identify Validation Needs

**Audit your current data**:
1. **Export existing data** to identify patterns and issues
2. **Look for inconsistencies** in formatting and values
3. **Identify missing data** in critical fields
4. **Find duplicate entries** that should be unique
5. **Note business rules** that aren't currently enforced

**Common data quality issues**:
- Inconsistent phone number formats
- Missing required information
- Invalid email addresses
- Unrealistic dates or numbers
- Duplicate records with slight variations

### Step 2: Design Validation Rules

**Prioritize by impact**:
1. **Critical business rules** that affect operations
2. **Data integrity rules** that prevent corruption
3. **Consistency rules** that improve user experience
4. **Nice-to-have rules** that enhance data quality

**Document your rules**:
- **Rule description**: What the rule checks
- **Business justification**: Why the rule is needed
- **Error message**: What users see when validation fails
- **Exceptions**: When the rule might not apply

### Step 3: Implement Validation Rules

**Field-level implementation**:
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Data Model**
2. Select the object and field you want to validate
3. Add validation criteria in the field settings
4. Configure error messages for failed validation
5. Test the validation with sample data

**Workflow-based validation**:
1. Create workflows that trigger on record creation/update
2. Add condition nodes to check validation criteria
3. Use action nodes to prevent saving or show warnings
4. Send notifications for validation failures

### Step 4: Configure Error Messages

**User-friendly messages**:
- **Be specific**: Explain exactly what's wrong
- **Be helpful**: Suggest how to fix the issue
- **Be professional**: Use clear, polite language
- **Be actionable**: Tell users what they need to do

**Good error message examples**:
```
❌ "Invalid format"
✅ "Phone number must be in format (XXX) XXX-XXXX"

❌ "Date error"
✅ "Close date must be in the future and within the next 2 years"

❌ "Required field"
✅ "Manager approval is required for deals over $50,000"
```

## Advanced Validation Techniques

### Custom Validation Logic

**Using workflows for complex validation**:
- **Multi-field calculations**: Validate based on computed values
- **External data validation**: Check against external systems
- **Time-based validation**: Rules that change based on time
- **User-specific validation**: Different rules for different users

**Example: Complex deal validation**:
```
Workflow Trigger: Deal record updated
Conditions:
  IF Deal Amount > $100,000 AND Discount > 15%
  THEN Require VP approval AND Detailed justification
  ELSE IF Deal Amount > $50,000 AND Discount > 10%
  THEN Require Manager approval
Actions:
  Create approval task
  Send notification
  Set record status to "Pending Approval"
```

### Integration-Based Validation

**External system validation**:
- **Address validation**: Verify addresses against postal services
- **Email validation**: Check email deliverability
- **Tax ID validation**: Verify business registration numbers
- **Credit checks**: Validate financial information

**Implementation approach**:
1. **Set up webhooks** to external validation services
2. **Create workflows** that trigger validation checks
3. **Handle responses** and update records accordingly
4. **Provide feedback** to users about validation results

### Batch Validation

**Validating existing data**:
- **Run validation checks** on historical data
- **Identify non-compliant records** for cleanup
- **Bulk update records** to meet new validation rules
- **Generate reports** on data quality improvements

**Process**:
1. **Export data** for analysis
2. **Identify violations** of new validation rules
3. **Clean data** in batches
4. **Re-import** corrected data
5. **Apply validation rules** to prevent future issues

## Common Validation Patterns

### Contact Information Validation

**Phone numbers**:
```
Pattern: ^\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}$
Example: (555) 123-4567
Error: "Phone must be in format (XXX) XXX-XXXX"
```

**Email addresses**:
```
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
Business rule: No personal email domains for work contacts
Error: "Please use a business email address"
```

**Addresses**:
```
Required fields: Street, City, State, Postal Code
Validation: State must be valid 2-letter code
Validation: Postal code must match state format
```

### Financial Data Validation

**Currency amounts**:
```
Range: $0.01 to $999,999,999.99
Format: Two decimal places maximum
Business rule: Deal amount must be positive
Error: "Amount must be greater than $0"
```

**Percentages**:
```
Range: 0% to 100%
Format: Whole numbers or one decimal place
Business rule: Probability must increase with stage progression
Error: "Probability must be between 0% and 100%"
```

### Date and Time Validation

**Business dates**:
```
Close Date: Must be in future, within 2 years
Contract dates: End date must be after start date
Follow-up dates: Must be business days only
Meeting times: Must be during business hours
```

**Historical dates**:
```
Founded Date: Must be in past, after 1800
Last Contact: Cannot be in future
Birth Date: Must be reasonable age range
```

## Testing Validation Rules

### Test Planning

**Create test scenarios**:
1. **Valid data**: Ensure good data passes validation
2. **Invalid data**: Confirm bad data is rejected
3. **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions
4. **User workflows**: Test common user interactions
5. **Bulk operations**: Test import and bulk update scenarios

### Testing Process

**Systematic testing**:
1. **Test each rule individually** before combining
2. **Use realistic test data** that mirrors actual usage
3. **Test with different user roles** and permissions
4. **Verify error messages** are clear and helpful
5. **Test performance impact** of validation rules

### Common Test Cases

**Boundary testing**:
- Test minimum and maximum values
- Test dates at the edge of acceptable ranges
- Test text at character limits
- Test numbers at precision limits

**Format testing**:
- Test various phone number formats
- Test different email address patterns
- Test date formats and invalid dates
- Test special characters and unicode

## Monitoring and Maintenance
