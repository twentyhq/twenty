## What are Relation Fields?

Relation fields link records from one object to records in another object. For example:
- **People** → **Companies** (each person works for a company)
- **Opportunities** → **People** (each deal has a contact person)
- **Tasks** → **Opportunities** (each task relates to a specific deal)

## Creating Relation Fields

### 1. Add the Field
Go to **Settings → Data Model → [Your Object]** and click **Add Field**.

### 2. Choose Relation Type
- **Field Type**: Select "Relation"
- **Target Object**: Choose which object to connect to
- **Relationship**: Currently supports **1-to-many** relationships only. Make sure to create the relationship in the right direction.

### 3. Configure Field Names
You'll need to set names for both sides of the relationship:
- **Source field name**: How the field appears on your current object
- **Target field name**: How the reverse field appears on the target object

<Warning>
Field names cannot be edited once the relation is saved as it impacts the API structure. Choose carefully.
</Warning>

## Relating to Team Members

You can create relations to any object, including **Workspace Members** (your Twenty team users). This is useful for creating ownership fields:

- **Account Owner**: Link a Company to a team member who manages it
- **Deal Owner**: Assign an Opportunity to a specific salesperson

When you create a relation to`Workspace Members`, you'll see your team members' names in dropdown selections, making it easy to assign ownership and responsibilities.

## Morph Many Relationships

Morph Many relationships allow a single field to connect to multiple different object types, providing flexible data modeling for complex business scenarios.

### What are Morph Many Relationships?

With Morph Many relationships, one object can relate to different types of objects through a single field. For example:
- An **Opportunity** can relate to either a **Person** or a **Company**
- A **Task** can be associated with any type of record (Person, Company, Deal, etc.)
- An **Attachment** can be linked to multiple different object types

### Creating Morph Many Relationships

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model → [Your Object]**
2. Click **Add Field** and select **Relation**
3. Choose **Morph Many** as the relationship type
4. Select the target object types you want to connect to
5. Configure the field names for each side of the relationship

This feature gives you the flexibility to create versatile relationships that adapt to your unique business processes without creating multiple separate fields.

## Best Practices

- **Plan your relationships** before creating them
- **Use clear, descriptive names** for both field names
- **Test relationships** with sample data before full implementation
- **Consider Morph Many** when a field needs to connect to multiple object types

## Upcoming Features
- **Many-to-many relationships** (Coming Q1 2026)
