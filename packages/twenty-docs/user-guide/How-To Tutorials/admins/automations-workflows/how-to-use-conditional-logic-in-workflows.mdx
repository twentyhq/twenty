Conditional logic is what makes workflows truly powerful. Instead of running the same actions every time, you can create workflows that make intelligent decisions based on your data, ensuring the right actions happen at the right time for the right records.

## Understanding Conditional Logic

### What is Conditional Logic?
Conditional logic allows workflows to evaluate data and make decisions about which actions to take. It's like creating "if-then" rules that help your workflow respond appropriately to different situations.

**Basic structure**:
- **IF** a condition is true
- **THEN** perform specific actions
- **ELSE** perform different actions (optional)

### Why Use Conditional Logic?
- **Personalization**: Different actions for different types of records
- **Efficiency**: Only run actions when they're actually needed
- **Accuracy**: Ensure actions are appropriate for the specific situation
- **Flexibility**: Handle multiple scenarios within a single workflow

## Types of Conditions

### Field-Based Conditions

**Single field conditions**:
- Check if a field equals a specific value
- Compare numbers (greater than, less than, etc.)
- Verify if a field is empty or has content
- Match text patterns or contains specific words

**Examples**:
- `Deal Amount > $10,000`
- `Lead Source = "Website"`
- `Company Industry = "Technology"`
- `Email is not empty`

### Multi-Field Conditions

**Combining multiple conditions**:
- Use AND logic (all conditions must be true)
- Use OR logic (any condition can be true)
- Create complex combinations of conditions
- Group conditions for clarity

**Examples**:
- `Deal Amount > $5,000 AND Stage = "Proposal"`
- `Lead Source = "Trade Show" OR Lead Source = "Referral"`
- `(Industry = "Healthcare" OR Industry = "Finance") AND Employee Count > 100`

### Relationship-Based Conditions

**Conditions on related records**:
- Check properties of linked records
- Count related records
- Verify relationships exist
- Compare data across objects

**Examples**:
- `Company.Industry = "Manufacturing"`
- `Person.Company.Employee Count > 500`
- `Opportunity.Point of Contact is not empty`
- `Count of Tasks > 3`

## Building Conditional Workflows

### Step 1: Plan Your Logic

**Before creating the workflow**:
1. **Identify scenarios**: What different situations need different actions?
2. **Define conditions**: What data determines which scenario applies?
3. **Map actions**: What should happen in each scenario?
4. **Consider edge cases**: What happens if conditions aren't met?

**Example planning**:
- **Scenario 1**: High-value deals (>$50K) need manager approval
- **Scenario 2**: Medium deals ($10K-$50K) need team lead review
- **Scenario 3**: Small deals (<$10K) auto-approve

### Step 2: Create the Workflow Structure

**Basic workflow setup**:
1. Choose your trigger (when the workflow runs)
2. Add a condition node to evaluate your logic
3. Define the condition criteria
4. Add action branches for different outcomes

### Step 3: Configure Conditions

**Setting up condition nodes**:
1. **Add condition**: Insert a condition node in your workflow
2. **Choose field**: Select the field you want to evaluate
3. **Set operator**: Choose how to compare (equals, greater than, etc.)
4. **Define value**: Set the value to compare against
5. **Add logic**: Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR

### Step 4: Define Action Branches

**True branch** (condition is met):
- Add actions that should happen when the condition is true
- Can include multiple actions in sequence
- Can have nested conditions for more complex logic

**False branch** (condition is not met):
- Add actions for when the condition is false
- Optional - you can leave this empty if no action is needed
- Can redirect to different logic paths

## Common Conditional Logic Patterns

### Lead Scoring and Routing

**Scenario**: Route leads to different teams based on company size and industry.

**Conditions**:
```
IF Company.Employee Count > 1000 AND Company.Industry = "Enterprise Software"
THEN Assign to Enterprise Sales Team
ELSE IF Company.Employee Count > 100
THEN Assign to Mid-Market Team
ELSE Assign to SMB Team
```

**Implementation**:
1. **First condition**: Check for enterprise criteria
2. **Second condition**: Check for mid-market size
3. **Default action**: Route to SMB team

### Deal Approval Workflow

**Scenario**: Different approval processes based on deal size and discount.

**Conditions**:
```
IF Deal Amount > $100,000 OR Discount > 20%
THEN Require VP Approval
ELSE IF Deal Amount > $25,000 OR Discount > 10%
THEN Require Manager Approval
ELSE Auto-Approve
```

**Actions for each branch**:
- **VP Approval**: Create task for VP, send notification, set status to "Pending VP"
- **Manager Approval**: Create task for manager, send notification, set status to "Pending Manager"
- **Auto-Approve**: Update status to "Approved", send confirmation email

### Customer Onboarding

**Scenario**: Different onboarding processes for different customer types.

**Conditions**:
```
IF Deal.Type = "New Customer" AND Company.Industry = "Healthcare"
THEN Healthcare Onboarding Process
ELSE IF Deal.Type = "New Customer"
THEN Standard Onboarding Process
ELSE IF Deal.Type = "Upsell"
THEN Expansion Onboarding Process
```

**Branch actions**:
- **Healthcare**: Compliance tasks, specialized training, regulatory setup
- **Standard**: Basic setup tasks, standard training materials
- **Expansion**: Feature training, integration setup, success check-in

## Advanced Conditional Techniques

### Nested Conditions

**Multiple levels of logic**:
```
IF Lead Source = "Website"
  THEN IF Company Size = "Enterprise"
    THEN Enterprise Web Lead Process
    ELSE SMB Web Lead Process
ELSE IF Lead Source = "Trade Show"
  THEN IF Event = "Dreamforce"
    THEN Premium Event Follow-up
    ELSE Standard Event Follow-up
```

**When to use nested conditions**:
- Complex decision trees with multiple factors
- When actions depend on combinations of conditions
- To avoid creating too many separate workflows

### Dynamic Value Conditions

**Using calculated values**:
- Compare fields against other fields (not just static values)
- Use formulas in conditions
- Reference related record data
- Calculate dates and time periods

**Examples**:
```
IF Close Date < Today + 30 days
IF Deal Amount > Company.Annual Revenue * 0.1
IF Days Since Last Contact > 14
```

### Time-Based Conditions

**Date and time logic**:
- Check if dates are in the past or future
- Compare time periods
- Evaluate business hours or days
- Handle timezone considerations

**Examples**:
```
IF Created Date = Today
IF Close Date is in the next 7 days
IF Last Activity > 30 days ago
IF Current Time is between 9 AM and 5 PM
```

## Testing Conditional Logic

### Test Planning

**Before going live**:
1. **Create test data**: Set up records that match each condition scenario
2. **Document expected outcomes**: What should happen for each test case?
3. **Test edge cases**: What happens with unusual or missing data?
4. **Verify all branches**: Ensure every condition path works correctly

### Testing Process

**Step-by-step testing**:
1. **Trigger the workflow** with test data
2. **Monitor execution**: Watch which conditions are evaluated
3. **Verify actions**: Confirm the correct actions are taken
4. **Check data changes**: Ensure records are updated correctly
5. **Test error handling**: See what happens with invalid data

### Common Testing Scenarios

**Test cases to include**:
- Records that meet the primary condition
- Records that meet alternative conditions
- Records that don't meet any conditions
- Records with missing or null data
- Records with extreme values (very high/low numbers)

## Troubleshooting Conditional Logic

### Common Issues

**Conditions not working as expected**:
- **Check data types**: Ensure you're comparing compatible data types
- **Verify field names**: Make sure field references are correct
- **Test with real data**: Use actual workspace data, not just test records
- **Review operator logic**: Confirm you're using the right comparison operators

**Actions not triggering**:
- **Trace execution path**: Follow which conditions are being evaluated
- **Check condition order**: Earlier conditions might be catching records first
- **Verify permissions**: Ensure the workflow can access and modify the required data
- **Review error logs**: Look for any execution errors or warnings

### Debugging Techniques

**Workflow monitoring**:
- Use workflow execution logs to see what happened
- Add temporary actions to track which conditions are met
- Test with simplified conditions first, then add complexity
- Monitor workflow performance and execution times

**Data validation**:
- Check that your data matches what you expect
- Verify that related records exist and have the expected values
- Ensure date formats and number formats are consistent
- Test with both typical and edge-case data

## Best Practices for Conditional Logic

### Design Principles

**Keep it simple**:
- Start with basic conditions and add complexity gradually
- Use clear, descriptive condition names
- Document your logic for future reference
- Avoid overly complex nested conditions when possible

**Plan for maintainability**:
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related conditions together
- Comment your logic for clarity
- Regular review and cleanup of unused conditions

### Performance Considerations

**Optimize for efficiency**:
- Put most common conditions first
- Avoid unnecessary complex calculations
- Use indexed fields in conditions when possible
- Consider the impact of frequent workflow executions

**Monitor resource usage**:
- Track workflow execution times
- Monitor for workflows that run too frequently
- Optimize conditions that involve large datasets
- Consider breaking complex workflows into smaller ones

### Error Handling

**Plan for failures**:
- Include default actions for when conditions fail
- Handle missing or null data gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Set up alerts for workflow failures

## Real-World Examples

### Sales Process Automation

**Lead qualification workflow**:
```
Trigger: New lead created
Condition 1: IF Lead Score > 80 AND Budget > $50,000
  Action: Assign to senior sales rep, create high-priority task
Condition 2: ELSE IF Lead Score > 50
  Action: Assign to junior sales rep, create standard task
Condition 3: ELSE
  Action: Add to nurture campaign, schedule follow-up in 30 days
```

### Customer Success Automation

**Health score monitoring**:
```
Trigger: Weekly schedule
Condition 1: IF Health Score < 30 AND Contract Value > $100,000
  Action: Create urgent task for CSM, alert VP of Customer Success
Condition 2: ELSE IF Health Score < 50
  Action: Create task for CSM, schedule check-in call
Condition 3: ELSE IF Health Score > 80
  Action: Create upsell opportunity, notify account manager
```

### Support Ticket Routing

**Priority-based routing**:
```
Trigger: New support ticket created
Condition 1: IF Priority = "Critical" AND Customer Tier = "Enterprise"
  Action: Assign to senior engineer, send SMS alert, escalate to manager
Condition 2: ELSE IF Priority = "High" OR Customer Tier = "Enterprise"
  Action: Assign to experienced engineer, send email alert
Condition 3: ELSE
  Action: Assign to general support queue
```
