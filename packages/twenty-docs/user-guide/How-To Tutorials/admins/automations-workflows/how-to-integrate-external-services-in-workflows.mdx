Below are workflow examples you could roll out to connect Twenty with the rest of your stack.

## Integration Patterns

### Data Ingestion (Bringing Data In)
Pull information from external sources into Twenty to enrich your CRM data and automate record creation.

### Data Distribution (Sending Data Out)
Push Twenty data to other systems to trigger actions, update records, or sync information across your business tools.

### Bidirectional Sync
Maintain consistent data between Twenty and external systems with two-way synchronization.

## Common Integration Examples

### Marketing and Lead Generation

**Webform to CRM**
Automatically create Person and Company records when someone fills out a form on your website.

**Newsletter Management**
Sync customer data with email marketing platforms to maintain accurate subscriber lists.

**Lead Scoring**
Send lead information to external scoring services and update Twenty with enriched data.

### Sales and Revenue Operations

**Proposal Generation**
Trigger document creation in external tools when opportunities reach proposal stage.

**Contract Management**
Create contracts in legal platforms when deals are marked as closed-won.

**Invoice Generation**
Automatically generate invoices in billing systems when opportunities close.

### Customer Success and Support

**Onboarding Automation**
Create customer accounts in product platforms when deals close.

**Support Ticket Creation**
Generate support tickets in helpdesk systems based on CRM activities.

**Health Score Updates**
Pull customer usage data from product analytics to update health scores in Twenty.

### Data Enrichment and Intelligence

**Company Information**
Enrich company records with data from business intelligence services.

**Contact Verification**
Validate email addresses and phone numbers using external verification services.

**Social Media Data**
Pull social media profiles and activity data to enhance contact records.

## Building External Integrations

### Step 1: Identify Integration Points
Map out your business processes:
- Where does data currently move manually between systems?
- Which external tools contain information that would be valuable in Twenty?
- What Twenty data would be useful in other systems?

### Step 2: Choose Integration Method
Select the appropriate integration approach:
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications when events occur
- **API Calls**: Direct communication with external services
- **File Transfers**: Batch data exchange via CSV or other formats
- **Third-party Platforms**: Use integration services like Zapier or Make

### Step 3: Design the Data Flow
Plan how information will move:
- **Trigger events**: What causes the integration to run?
- **Data mapping**: How do fields in Twenty correspond to external system fields?
- **Error handling**: What happens when integrations fail?
- **Data validation**: How do you ensure data quality?

### Step 4: Implement and Test
Build the integration:
1. Create the workflow in Twenty
2. Configure external system connections
3. Test with sample data
4. Monitor for errors and edge cases
5. Deploy to production

## Example: Webform to CRM Integration

### Business Need
Your website has a contact form, but leads need to be manually entered into Twenty, causing delays and potential data loss.

### Integration Solution
**Trigger**: HTTP Request (webhook from your website)
**Data Processing**:
- Parse form data from webhook payload
- Check if company already exists in Twenty
- Create or update company record
- Create person record linked to company
- Assign lead to appropriate sales rep

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Receive webhook**: Form submission triggers workflow
2. **Parse data**: Extract name, email, company, message from payload
3. **Company lookup**: Search for existing company by domain
4. **Create/update company**: Add company if it doesn't exist
5. **Create person**: Add contact linked to company
6. **Lead assignment**: Route to appropriate sales rep based on rules
7. **Notification**: Alert assigned rep of new lead

### Implementation Benefits
- Instant lead capture without manual data entry
- Consistent data format and completeness
- Automatic lead routing and assignment
- Real-time notifications to sales team

## Example: Billing System Integration

### Business Need
When opportunities close in Twenty, invoices need to be created in your billing system, but this currently requires manual data entry.

### Integration Solution
**Trigger**: Record Updated (Opportunity stage = "Closed Won")
**External Action**: Create invoice in billing system via API

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Opportunity closes**: Trigger fires when stage changes to "Closed Won"
2. **Gather data**: Collect opportunity amount, company info, line items
3. **Format payload**: Structure data for billing system API
4. **API call**: Send invoice creation request to billing system
5. **Handle response**: Process success/error response from billing system
6. **Update Twenty**: Add invoice ID and status to opportunity record
7. **Notifications**: Alert accounting team of new invoice

### Error Handling
- Retry failed API calls with exponential backoff
- Log errors for manual review and correction
- Send alerts when integrations fail
- Maintain data consistency between systems

## Example: Customer Data Enrichment

### Business Need
Your sales team needs more information about companies and contacts to improve their outreach and qualification.

### Integration Solution
**Trigger**: Record Created (Company object)
**External Service**: Business intelligence API for company data

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **New company created**: Workflow triggers on company creation
2. **API lookup**: Query external service with company domain
3. **Data processing**: Parse and validate returned company data
4. **Field mapping**: Map external data to Twenty fields
5. **Record update**: Enrich company record with new information
6. **Quality check**: Validate data accuracy and completeness
7. **Team notification**: Alert sales rep of enriched data availability

### Data Enrichment Fields
- Company size and employee count
- Industry classification and tags
- Revenue and funding information
- Technology stack and tools used
- Social media profiles and activity
- News and recent developments

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Conditional Integrations
Create smart integrations that adapt based on data:
- Only enrich companies above a certain size threshold
- Route different types of leads to different external systems
- Apply different processing rules based on data source

### Multi-step Integrations
Chain multiple external services together:
1. Enrich company data from business intelligence service
2. Verify contact information through email validation service
3. Score lead using external lead scoring platform
4. Route to appropriate sales tools based on score

### Batch Processing
Handle large volumes of data efficiently:
- Process multiple records in single API calls
- Schedule batch updates during off-peak hours
- Implement queuing for high-volume integrations

## Integration Security and Compliance

### Authentication and Authorization
- Use secure authentication methods (OAuth, API keys)
- Implement proper access controls and permissions
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Data Privacy and Protection
- Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations
- Implement data encryption in transit and at rest
- Maintain audit trails of data access and modifications
- Provide data deletion capabilities when required

### Error Handling and Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive logging for all integration activities
- Set up alerts for integration failures and anomalies
- Create dashboards to monitor integration health and performance
- Establish procedures for handling integration outages

## Best Practices for External Integrations

### Start with High-Value, Low-Risk Integrations
- Begin with integrations that provide clear business value
- Choose reliable external services with good API documentation
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production

### Design for Reliability
- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Handle rate limits and API quotas gracefully
- Plan for external service downtime and degradation

### Maintain Data Quality
- Validate data before sending to external systems
- Implement data transformation and cleaning logic
- Monitor for data inconsistencies between systems

### Document and Monitor
- Document all integration flows and dependencies
- Create runbooks for troubleshooting common issues
