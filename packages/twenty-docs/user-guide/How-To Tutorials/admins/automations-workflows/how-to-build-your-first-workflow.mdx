## Quick Summary

**What are Workflows?** Automated processes that trigger actions based on specific conditions in your CRM.

**Key Components:**
- **Triggers:** What starts the workflow (record created, field updated, scheduled time)
- **Actions:** What happens (send email, create task, update record, call external API)
- **Conditions:** Logic to control when actions execute

**Common Use Cases:** Lead assignment, follow-up reminders, data synchronization, notification alerts, pipeline automation.

## Why Workflows Matter

Twenty was built to bring maximum flexibility to its users. Rather than forcing you to adapt your business processes to rigid, pre-built features, workflows enable you to build automations that create the CRM that best supports your unique business use cases.

Workflows are Twenty's in-app feature for building these automations. They give you the building blocks to create exactly what your business needs, when it needs it.

## What can I do with workflows?

We recommend building automations for two main purposes:

1. **Internal automations to facilitate your team's day-to-day**: Reduce the amount of manual entries and repetitive tasks that slow down your team.
2. **Bring data in and out of Twenty**: Connect Twenty via API calls and webhooks to your database and other tools.

Let's explore examples of what's possible before diving into the how.

## 1. Internal Automations

Your CRM is only helpful if the data is up to date, but no one likes updating it. Use workflows to automate low-value, repeatable tasks and keep your team focused on what matters.

Examples of what you can automate internally:

**Automatic task creation**: When a deal moves to "Negotiation" stage, automatically create a task for the account owner to "Send proposal" with a due date of 3 days.

**Lead scoring and qualification**: When a new person is created, automatically score them based on their company size, industry, and role. If they meet your ideal customer profile criteria, automatically move them to a "Qualified Lead" status.

**Data enrichment**: When a new company is added with just a domain name, automatically fetch additional information like company size, industry, and social media profiles from external APIs.

**Follow-up reminders**: If no activity has been logged on a deal for 7 days, automatically create a reminder task for the deal owner.

**Status updates**: When a deal is marked as "Closed Won", automatically update the associated company's status to "Customer" and create a welcome task for the customer success team.

## 2. External Integrations

Connect Twenty to your broader tech stack to keep data synchronized and trigger actions across multiple systems.

Examples of external integrations:

**Website lead capture**: When someone fills out a form on your website, automatically create a new person and company record in Twenty, then notify the sales team via Slack.

**Email marketing sync**: When a deal is closed won, automatically add the contact to your "Customer" email list in your marketing automation platform.

**Support ticket creation**: When a customer reports an issue via email, automatically create a support case in your helpdesk system and link it to their company record in Twenty.

**Billing integration**: When a deal is marked as closed won, automatically create a customer record in your billing system and trigger the first invoice.

**Calendar scheduling**: When a deal reaches the "Demo Scheduled" stage, automatically create a calendar event and send meeting invites to all stakeholders.

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first workflow? Here's how to begin:

### Step 1: Access Workflows
1. In your Twenty workspace, look for the **Workflows** section in the left sidebar
2. Click **Create Workflow** to start building

### Step 2: Choose Your Trigger
Every workflow starts with a trigger - the event that kicks off your automation:
- **Record Created**: When a new record is added
- **Record Updated**: When an existing record is modified
- **Time-based**: On a schedule or after a delay
- **Manual**: Triggered by a user action

### Step 3: Add Actions
Once triggered, your workflow can perform various actions:
- Create or update records
- Send emails or notifications
- Make API calls to external systems
- Create tasks or calendar events

### Step 4: Test and Activate
Before going live:
1. Test your workflow with sample data
2. Verify all actions work as expected
3. Activate the workflow to start automation

## Best Practices

**Start Simple**: Begin with basic automations and add complexity over time.

**Test Thoroughly**: Always test workflows with real data before activating them.

**Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on workflow execution to catch any issues early.

**Document Your Logic**: Add clear descriptions so team members understand what each workflow does.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need coding skills to create workflows?">
No, Twenty's workflow builder uses a visual interface. You can create most automations by selecting triggers and actions from dropdown menus. Advanced users can add custom code if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many workflows can I create?">
There's no limit to the number of workflows you can create. However, each workflow execution counts toward your usage limits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can workflows integrate with external tools?">
Yes, workflows can make HTTP requests to external APIs, send webhooks, and integrate with thousands of services. This allows you to connect Twenty with your existing tech stack.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if a workflow fails?">
Failed workflows are logged with error details. You can view execution history, debug issues, and retry failed runs. Workflows won't break your data - they fail safely.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I pause or disable workflows?">
Yes, you can activate, deactivate, or delete workflows at any time. Deactivated workflows stop running but preserve their configuration for future use.
