## Advanced Filtering Techniques

### Multiple Conditions
Combine filters for precise results:

- **Text searches**: Use "contains" for partial matches

### Relationship Filters
Filter based on related record data:
- **Company size**: Filter people by their company's employee count
- **Deal stage**: Filter activities by their opportunity's stage
- **Account type**: Filter contacts by their company's industry

### Dynamic Filters
Create filters that update automatically:
- **This week**: Use relative date filters
- **My records**: Filter by current user
- **Recent activity**: Use "modified in last X days"
- **Upcoming deadlines**: Filter by future dates
