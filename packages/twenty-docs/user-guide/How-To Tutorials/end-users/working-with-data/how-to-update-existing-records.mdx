4. Click Save

### Using the Command Menu

2. Type "Create" and select the object type
3. Fill in the form and save

### Quick Create from Relationships
When viewing a record, you can create related records directly:
1. Click on a relation field
2. Select "Create new" instead of linking existing
3. The new record will be automatically linked

## Editing Records

2. Make your changes
3. Press Enter or click outside to save

### Record Detail View

2. Edit any field directly
3. Changes are saved automatically

### Bulk Editing
To update multiple records at once:

## Managing Record Relationships

### Linking Records
Connect records to show relationships:
