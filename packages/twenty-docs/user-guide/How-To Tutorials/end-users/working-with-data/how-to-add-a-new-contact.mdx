## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 3: Add Basic Information

Fill in the essential contact details:

1. **Name**: Enter the person's full name
   - First Name and Last Name are separate fields
   - Both fields are required

2. **Email**: Add their primary email address
   - This field must be unique (no duplicates allowed)
   - Twenty will prevent you from saving if the email already exists

3. **Phone**: Enter their phone number
   - Include country code if different from your default
   - Format will be automatically standardized

## What Happens Next

After saving your new contact:

### Automatic Actions
- The contact appears in your People list immediately
- If you linked them to a company, that relationship is established
- Their email becomes searchable across your workspace
- They're available for linking to opportunities, tasks, and notes

### Email Integration
If you have email sync enabled:
- Future emails with this contact will be automatically logged
- Their communication history will build over time
- Email threads will appear in their record timeline

## Tips for Success

### Data Quality
- Always include an email address when possible
- Link contacts to companies to build relationship maps
- Use consistent formatting for phone numbers and addresses
- Add job titles to understand organizational structure

### Avoiding Duplicates
- Search existing contacts before creating new ones
- Twenty prevents duplicate emails but check names too
- Use the merge feature if you accidentally create duplicates
- Consider using [import tools](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/working-with-data/how-to-import-data-using-csv-files) for bulk additions

### Organization
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add contacts to relevant views and filters
- Tag or categorize contacts using custom fields
- Keep information up-to-date as relationships change

## Common Scenarios

### Adding a Lead from a Business Card
1. Take a photo of the business card for reference
2. Enter their information as described above
3. Add a note about where you met them
4. Create a follow-up task if needed

### Adding Someone You Met at an Event
1. Add their basic contact information
2. Include the event name in a custom field or note
3. Link them to their company
4. Set a reminder task to follow up within a few days

### Adding a Referral
1. Enter their contact information
2. Add a note about who referred them
3. Link to the referring contact if they're in your system
4. Create a task to reach out and mention the referral

## Troubleshooting

### Email Already Exists Error
If you get an error that the email already exists:
1. Search for the existing contact
2. Update their information instead of creating a new record
3. Use the [merge feature](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/working-with-data/how-to-merge-duplicate-contacts-or-companies) if you have duplicates

### Company Not Found
If you can't find the company to link:
1. Create the company first using the "Create [Company Name]" option
2. Or [add the company separately](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/working-with-data/how-to-add-a-company-and-link-contacts) then return to link the contact

### Missing Fields
If you don't see expected fields:
1. Check if they're hidden in the current view
2. Ask your administrator about custom fields
3. Use the [field customization](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/working-with-data/how-to-create-a-custom-field) feature if needed

## What's Next?

Now that you've added a contact, you might want to:

1. [Add their company](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/working-with-data/how-to-add-a-company-and-link-contacts) if you haven't already
2. [Create a task](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/notes-tasks-collaboration/how-to-create-and-assign-tasks) to follow up with them
3. [Add notes](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/notes-tasks-collaboration/how-to-add-notes) about your relationship or conversations
4. [Set up email tracking](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/email-calendar-activity-tracking/how-to-connect-my-mailbox) to automatically log communications

Adding contacts is the foundation of effective CRM use. The more complete and accurate your contact information, the more valuable your CRM becomes for managing relationships and driving business growth.
