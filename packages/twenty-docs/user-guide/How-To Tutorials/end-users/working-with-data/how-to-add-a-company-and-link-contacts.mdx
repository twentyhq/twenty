## Getting data into your CRM

When you start using Twenty, you'll want to get your contacts and companies into the system. There are several ways to populate your CRM depending on your workflow and data sources.

### Manual entry

The most straightforward approach is adding records directly through the Twenty interface. Go to the `People` section and click the `+` button to add a new contact. Fill in their name, email, phone, and link them to their company. For companies, head to the `Companies` section and add the organization details: company name, domain, industry, and size.

The domain field is particularly important for company identification, and the email field is essential for person identification.

### CSV imports

When you have existing data from spreadsheets or other systems, CSV import is your fastest option. You can prepare your data in Excel or Google Sheets, then upload it all at once. This is particularly useful when migrating from another CRM or when someone has been tracking contacts in spreadsheets. Our [Import/Export Data](/user-guide/Getting Started with Twenty/import-export/import-data-from-csv) guide walks you through the process.

### Automated data capture

For ongoing lead generation, you can set up automated workflows that bring data directly into Twenty:

**Website forms**: When someone fills out a form on your website, you can configure it to send the information to Twenty automatically. The form submission triggers a webhook that activates a workflow in Twenty, creating the new contact record without any manual work.

**Integration with other systems**: If you use other business tools, you can connect them to Twenty using API calls and workflows. This lets you automatically sync data between systems: for example, bringing in new customers from your billing system or leads from your marketing platform.

To learn more about setting up these automated data flows, check out our [Workflows](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/admins/automations-workflows/how-to-build-your-first-workflow) section.

### Email and calendar sync

When you connect your mailbox and calendar to Twenty, the system can automatically create People and Companies records for people you email or meet with. If you send an email to someone who isn't already in your CRM, Twenty can create a new Person record for them. The same happens when you schedule meetings with new contacts through your calendar.

This is particularly useful for sales and business development teams who are constantly meeting new people. Instead of manually adding every new contact, Twenty captures them automatically as you communicate. Learn how to set this up in our [Emails and Calendars](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/email-calendar-activity-tracking/how-to-connect-my-mailbox) guide.

### Reducing manual work

Even when adding data manually, you can use workflows to streamline the process. For instance, you might set up automation that assigns new contacts to team members based on their location, or that automatically creates follow-up tasks when certain types of contacts are added.

## Organizing your contacts

### Keeping data unique and clean

Twenty automatically enforces uniqueness to keep your data organized. Each person's email address serves as a unique identifier: you can't have two people with the same email. Similarly, company domains are unique, so you won't accidentally create duplicate companies.

This helps maintain clean data, but it also means you need to be thoughtful about how you structure your information. If you have multiple contacts at the same company, they'll all link to the same company record, which is exactly what you want for tracking relationships and communication history.

### Using views to organize

Once you have contacts and companies in your system, views help you organize and access them efficiently. You can create different views for different purposes:

**Sales views**: Filter to show only prospects in your sales pipeline, or companies above a certain size that match your ideal customer profile.

**Support views**: Display customers who have open support tickets, or contacts who haven't been reached out to in a while.

**Team views**: Show contacts assigned to specific team members, or companies in particular regions.

Views are dynamic, so they automatically update as your data changes. A contact who moves from "prospect" to "customer" will automatically appear in the right views without any manual updating.

### Linking people to companies

When you add a new person, you can link them to an existing company or create a new company at the same time. This connection is important because it helps you:

**Track relationships**: See all the people you know at each company, and understand the full scope of your relationship with that organization.

**Organize communication**: View all emails and meetings with anyone at a company in one place, giving you complete context for your interactions.

**Manage opportunities**: Connect sales opportunities to companies and see which people are involved in each deal.

The company-person relationship is flexible: people can move between companies, and you can update these connections as your contacts change jobs.
