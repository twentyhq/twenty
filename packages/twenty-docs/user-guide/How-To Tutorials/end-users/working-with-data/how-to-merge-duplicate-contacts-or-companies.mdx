Duplicate records can clutter your CRM and make it hard to get accurate insights. Twenty provides tools to identify and merge duplicates while preserving all your important data and relationships.

## Why Duplicates Happen

Understanding how duplicates are created helps you prevent them:

**Common causes**:
- Multiple team members adding the same contact
- Importing data from different sources
- Slight variations in names or email addresses
- People changing jobs but keeping the same email
- Manual data entry errors

## Finding Duplicate Records

### Manual Detection
Look for these warning signs:
- Similar names with slight spelling differences
- Same company with different formatting
- Multiple records for the same person
- Identical email addresses (Twenty prevents this, but you might see variations)

### Using Views to Spot Duplicates
Create views that help identify potential duplicates:

**For People**:
1. Sort by last name to see similar names together
2. Filter by company to find multiple contacts at the same organization
3. Look for similar email domains

**For Companies**:
1. Sort alphabetically to spot similar company names
2. Check for different versions of the same domain
3. Look for variations in company formatting (Inc vs Incorporated)

### Search Techniques
Use Twenty's search to find potential duplicates:
- Search for partial names or company names
- Try different spellings or abbreviations
- Search by phone number or email domain

## Before You Merge: Preparation

### Review Both Records Carefully
Before merging, examine both records to understand:
- Which record has more complete information
- What unique data each record contains
- Any relationships or activities that might be lost
- Which record has the correct contact information

### Document Important Information
Make note of:
- Unique field values that should be preserved
- Related opportunities, tasks, or notes
- Any custom field data that differs between records
- Contact preferences or important notes

### Check Related Records
Look at what's connected to each duplicate:
- Opportunities and deals
- Tasks and activities
- Notes and communications
- Email and calendar history

## Merging Records Step by Step

<Note>
Currently, Twenty doesn't have an automated merge feature, but you can manually consolidate duplicate records effectively.
</Note>

### Step 1: Choose the Primary Record
Decide which record to keep as the primary one:
- Usually the one with more complete information
- The one with more recent activity
- The one with the correct email address
- The one that other team members are familiar with

### Step 2: Consolidate Information
Update the primary record with any missing information from the duplicate:
1. Open both records in separate tabs
2. Copy unique information from the duplicate to the primary record
3. Update any fields that have better data in the duplicate
4. Ensure all contact information is current and accurate

### Step 3: Transfer Relationships
Move important connections to the primary record:

**For Opportunities**:
1. Open each opportunity linked to the duplicate
2. Change the contact or company field to point to the primary record
3. Verify the relationship is correctly established

**For Tasks and Notes**:
1. Review tasks assigned to or related to the duplicate
2. Update the assignee or related record to the primary
3. Move important notes to the primary record

**For Activities**:
1. Check email and calendar history
2. Add important notes about past interactions to the primary record
3. Ensure no critical communication history is lost

### Step 4: Clean Up Custom Fields
If you have custom fields with different values:
1. Determine which values are correct or most recent
2. Update the primary record with the best information
3. Combine information where appropriate (like adding tags or categories)

### Step 5: Delete the Duplicate
Once you've transferred all important information:
1. Double-check that everything has been moved to the primary record
2. Verify all relationships are correctly established
3. Delete the duplicate record
4. Empty the trash if you're certain the merge is complete

## Merging Companies

### Special Considerations for Companies
Company merges require extra attention to:

**Domain Consistency**: Ensure the primary company has the correct domain format
**Employee Records**: All people linked to the duplicate company need to be relinked
**Opportunity History**: Sales history and deals must be preserved
**Integration Data**: Email and calendar sync data should be maintained

### Company Merge Process
1. **Identify the correct company record** (usually the one with the right domain)
2. **Update company information** with any missing details from the duplicate
3. **Relink all employees** from the duplicate company to the primary company
4. **Transfer all opportunities** associated with the duplicate company
5. **Move tasks and notes** related to the company
6. **Update any custom fields** with consolidated information
7. **Delete the duplicate company** after verification

## Preventing Future Duplicates

### Data Entry Best Practices
- Always search before creating new records
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Standardize company name formats
- Double-check email addresses for typos

### Import Guidelines
- Clean your data before importing
- Use Twenty's duplicate detection during import
- Import in small batches to catch issues early
- Review imported data for potential duplicates

### Team Training
- Train team members on search techniques
- Establish data entry standards
- Create guidelines for handling uncertain cases
- Regular team reviews of data quality

### Automated Prevention
Set up workflows to help prevent duplicates:
- Create alerts when similar records are created
- Automate data standardization (like company name formatting)
- Set up validation rules for critical fields
- Monitor for potential duplicates regularly

## Advanced Duplicate Management

### Handling Complex Cases
Some situations require special attention:

**Person Changed Companies**:
- Update their company relationship rather than creating a new record
- Preserve their history with the previous company
- Update contact information if needed

**Company Acquisitions**:
- Keep both company records if they maintain separate identities
- Link them with a relationship field if available
- Update people records to reflect new company structure

**Multiple Email Addresses**:
- Choose the primary email address for the main record
- Add other email addresses in notes or custom fields
- Ensure email sync uses the correct primary address

### Bulk Duplicate Handling
For large-scale duplicate issues:
1. **Export your data** to work with it in spreadsheet software
2. **Use duplicate detection tools** in Excel or Google Sheets
3. **Create a merge plan** before making changes in Twenty
4. **Process duplicates in batches** to maintain data quality
5. **Verify results** after each batch

## Quality Assurance After Merging

### Verification Checklist
After merging records, verify:
- [ ] All important information was preserved
- [ ] Relationships are correctly established
- [ ] No orphaned records exist
- [ ] Email and calendar sync still works
- [ ] Team members can find the consolidated record
- [ ] Reports and views show correct data

### Testing Integrations
If you use integrations, test that they still work correctly:
- Email sync with the merged contact
- Calendar integration with updated company
- Workflow triggers with consolidated data
- API connections with merged records

## Troubleshooting Merge Issues

### Lost Information
If you realize information was lost during a merge:
- Check if the deleted record is in trash and can be restored
- Review any notes or activity history that might contain the lost data
- Contact team members who might remember the missing information
- Check email history for additional context

### Broken Relationships
If relationships aren't working after a merge:
- Manually reestablish the connections
- Check permissions on the merged record
- Verify the related records still exist
- Update any workflows that might be affected

### Integration Problems
If integrations stop working after merging:
- Update integration settings with new record IDs
- Refresh connections to external systems
- Test email and calendar sync
- Contact support if issues persist
