Custom fields let you capture information that's unique to your business. Whether you need to track lead sources, customer preferences, or industry-specific data, custom fields make Twenty work exactly how you need it to.

## When to Create Custom Fields

Consider adding custom fields when you need to track:
- Information that doesn't fit in standard fields
- Business-specific data points
- Additional categorization or tagging
- Metrics or scores unique to your process
- Compliance or regulatory information

## Before You Start

### Check Your Permissions
You need admin permissions to create custom fields. If you don't see the Data Model section in Settings, contact your workspace administrator.

### Plan Your Field
Before creating the field, think about:
- What type of information you want to store
- How the field will be used in your workflow
- Whether the field should be required or optional
- What field type best fits your data

1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Add the Field
1. Click **+ Add Field** at the top right

Depending on the field type, you can set:
- **Required**: Whether the field must be filled in

## Using Custom Fields Effectively

### In Views
- Add custom fields to views where they're relevant
- Create filtered views based on custom field values
- Sort by custom fields to organize data
- Hide custom fields in views where they're not needed

### In Workflows
- Trigger workflows based on custom field changes
- Update custom fields automatically based on other data
- Use custom fields in conditional logic
- Send notifications when custom fields meet certain criteria

### In Reporting
- Group data by custom field values
- Calculate averages or totals for number fields
- Track trends in custom field data over time
- Create dashboards showing custom field metrics

## Managing Custom Fields

### Editing Fields
To modify an existing custom field:
1. Go to Settings → Data Model → [Object] → Fields
2. Click on the field you want to edit
3. Update the field properties
4. Save your changes

<Warning>
Changing field types can cause data loss. Always backup your data before making significant field changes.
</Warning>

### Deactivating Fields
If you no longer need a custom field:
1. Find the field in your field list
2. Toggle it to "Inactive"
3. The field will be hidden but data is preserved
4. You can reactivate it later if needed

### Field Dependencies
Consider how custom fields relate to each other:
- Some fields might only be relevant when others have certain values
- Create workflows to manage field dependencies
- Use conditional logic to show/hide fields based on other data
- Document field relationships for your team

## Troubleshooting Custom Fields

### Field Not Appearing
- Check that the field is active
- Verify you have permission to view the field
- Ensure you're looking at the correct object
- Refresh your browser if needed

### Data Not Saving
- Check field validation rules
- Verify the data format matches the field type
- Ensure required fields are filled in
- Check for character limits or other constraints

### Performance Issues
- Too many custom fields can slow down views
- Consider which fields are essential vs. nice-to-have
- Use field descriptions to help users understand when to use each field
- Regular review and cleanup of unused fields

## Advanced Custom Field Techniques

### Conditional Fields
While Twenty doesn't have built-in conditional fields, you can:
- Use workflows to populate fields based on other field values
- Create different views that show relevant fields for different scenarios
- Use field descriptions to guide when fields should be used

### Calculated Fields
For fields that should be calculated from other data:
- Use workflows to update calculated fields automatically
- Set up triggers when source data changes
- Consider using formula fields when they become available

### Integration Fields
For data that comes from external systems:
- Create fields to store external system IDs
- Use workflows to sync data from integrations
- Set up validation to ensure data consistency
