Relation fields are one of Twenty's most powerful features. They let you connect records from different objects, creating a web of relationships that mirrors your real business connections.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll know how to create meaningful connections between your people, companies, opportunities, and any custom objects you've created.

## Understanding Relation Fields

Think of relation fields as digital threads that connect related information. When you link a person to a company, you're not just storing data - you're creating a relationship that helps you understand the full context of your business interactions.

**Common relationships**:
- People work for Companies
- Opportunities belong to Companies
- Tasks are assigned to People
- Notes relate to any record type

## Linking Records Step by Step

### Step 1: Identify the Relationship
Before creating links, think about how your records relate to each other. Ask yourself:
- Does this person work for a specific company?
- Is this opportunity associated with a particular contact?
- Should this task be assigned to a team member?

### Step 2: Open the Record
1. Navigate to the record you want to link from
2. Click on the record to open its detail view
3. Look for relation fields (they usually show as dropdowns or search boxes)

### Step 3: Create the Link
1. Click on the relation field you want to populate
2. Start typing the name of the record you want to link to
3. Select the correct record from the search results
4. The link is created immediately

### Step 4: Verify the Connection
- Check that the linked record appears in the relation field
- Navigate to the linked record to see the reverse relationship
- Verify that all related information is now accessible

## Common Linking Scenarios

### Linking People to Companies

**When to do this**: Every time you add a new contact, link them to their company.

**How to do it**:
1. Open the person's record
2. Find the "Company" relation field
3. Type the company name or search for it
4. Select the correct company from the results

**What happens**: The person now appears in the company's "People" list, and you can see all company information when viewing the person.

### Connecting Opportunities to Contacts

**When to do this**: When you're tracking a sales opportunity and want to associate it with the main contact.

**How to do it**:
1. Open the opportunity record
2. Look for "Point of Contact" or similar relation field
3. Search for and select the primary contact
4. The opportunity is now linked to both the person and their company

**What happens**: You can see all opportunities when viewing the contact's record, and the opportunity shows contact information.

### Assigning Tasks to Records

**When to do this**: When you need to create follow-up actions related to specific people, companies, or deals.

**How to do it**:
1. Create or open a task
2. Use the "Relations" field to connect it to relevant records
3. You can link one task to multiple records (person, company, and opportunity)

**What happens**: The task appears in the timeline of all linked records, giving complete context.

## Advanced Linking Techniques

### Multi-Object Relationships
Some relation fields let you connect to multiple types of objects. For example, a task might relate to a person, their company, and an opportunity all at once.

**To create multi-object links**:
1. Open the record with the multi-relation field
2. Click the relation field
3. Search for records from any object type
4. Add as many connections as needed

### Bulk Linking
When you have many records that need the same relationship:

**Using views**:
1. Create a view that shows the records you want to link
2. Select multiple records using checkboxes
3. Use bulk edit to set the same relation field for all selected records

**During import**:
1. Include relation data in your CSV import
2. Use unique identifiers (email for people, domain for companies)
3. Twenty will create the relationships automatically

### Linking During Record Creation
You can create relationships while adding new records:

1. When creating a new person, start typing a company name in the Company field
2. If the company doesn't exist, select "Create new company"
3. Both the person and company are created with the relationship established

## Managing Existing Links

### Updating Relationships
To change an existing relationship:
1. Open the record with the relation field
2. Click on the current linked record
3. Clear the field and search for a new record to link
4. Select the new record to update the relationship

### Removing Links
To remove a relationship:
1. Click on the relation field
2. Click the "X" next to the linked record
3. The relationship is removed (but both records remain)

### Viewing All Relationships
To see all connections for a record:
1. Open the record's detail view
2. Scroll through all relation fields
3. Check the timeline for related activities
4. Use the "Related" tab if available

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Can't Find the Record to Link
**Problem**: The record you want to link to doesn't appear in search results.

**Solutions**:
- Check that the record actually exists
- Verify you have permission to view the target record
- Try searching with different terms (name, email, company)
- Check if the record is in a different object than expected

### Relationship Not Appearing
**Problem**: You created a link but don't see it reflected in both records.

**Solutions**:
- Refresh your browser
- Check that you have permission to view both sides of the relationship
- Verify the relationship was actually saved

### Wrong Record Linked
**Problem**: You accidentally linked to the wrong record.

**Solutions**:
- Open the relation field and remove the incorrect link
- Search for and select the correct record
- Double-check that you're linking the right records
