## Migration Overview

Migrating to Twenty involves:
1. Exporting data from your current CRM
2. Preparing the data for import
3. Setting up your Twenty data model
4. Importing data into Twenty
5. Verifying the migration

## Pre-Migration Planning

### Assess Your Data
- Identify what data to migrate
- Clean up duplicates and outdated records
- Document your current data structure
- Map your data to Twenty's model

### Plan Your Data Model
- Review Twenty's standard objects (People, Companies, Opportunities)
- Identify what custom objects you'll need
- Plan custom fields for each object
- Define relationships between objects

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Export from Your Current CRM

Most CRMs allow data export to CSV. Export:
- Contacts/People
- Companies/Accounts
- Deals/Opportunities
- Notes and Activities
- Custom objects

### Step 2: Prepare Your Data

**Clean your data**:
- Remove duplicates
- Fix formatting issues
- Standardize field values
- Remove unnecessary columns

**Format for Twenty**:
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding
- Use consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD recommended)
- Match field names to Twenty fields

### Step 3: Set Up Twenty

Before importing:
1. Create custom objects if needed
2. Add custom fields to match your data
3. Configure relations between objects
4. Set up select field options

### Step 4: Import Data

**Import order matters**:
1. Companies first (no dependencies)
2. People second (link to companies)
3. Opportunities (link to companies and people)
4. Notes and activities (link to records)
5. Custom objects as needed

**For each import**:
1. Navigate to the object
2. Click Options → Import
3. Upload your CSV
4. Map columns to fields
5. Review and confirm

### Step 5: Verify Migration

After importing:
- Spot check records for accuracy
- Verify relations are correct
- Check that all fields populated
- Test searching and filtering

## Common Migration Sources

### Salesforce
- Export using Data Export or Reports
- Map Account → Company
- Map Contact → People
- Map Opportunity → Opportunity

### HubSpot
- Export from each object separately
- Map Company → Company
- Map Contact → People
- Map Deal → Opportunity

### Pipedrive
- Export from Data Export settings

### Spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets)
- Save as CSV
- Ensure clean headers
- Remove formulas (export values only)

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
- Check file encoding (use UTF-8)
- Verify date formats
- Ensure required fields have values
- Check for special characters

### Missing Relations
- Verify related records exist before importing
- Use correct ID or unique field for matching
- Import in the correct order

### Duplicate Records
- Clean data before import
- Use unique fields to identify duplicates
- Merge duplicates after import if needed
