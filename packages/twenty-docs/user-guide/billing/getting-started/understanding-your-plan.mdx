## Workflow Credits

Credits power your workflow automations:

| Billing Cycle | Credits |
|---------------|---------|
| Monthly | 5 million/month |
| Yearly | 50 million/year |

Credits are the same across all plans—only the billing cycle matters.

### Credit Consumption
Different actions consume different amounts of credits:
- **Basic operations** (search, update, create): Minimal credits
- **Complex operations** (code nodes, external API calls): More credits
- **AI prompts** (coming soon): Variable based on usage

<Note>
The 5 million monthly credits are designed to empower you to run automations without worrying about costs. For most workflows using standard actions, this is more than enough. You'll only need additional credits when running advanced code nodes or AI-powered features.
