## Pricing

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I use Twenty for free while self-hosting?">
Yes, you can use Twenty for free while self-hosting. You will get access to everything included in the Pro (Cloud) plan, except the support from our core-team. Support is accessible via our Discord community.

If you want to self-host and need the Premium features (SSO and row-level permissions), you can choose the paid Organization (Self-Hosted) license. This also includes support from the Twenty team and removes the requirement to publish custom code as open-source before distributing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the Premium features?">
Premium features are only available on the Organization plans (Cloud or Self-Hosted):
- **SSO integration**: Single Sign-On with your identity provider
- **Row-level permissions**: Fine-grained access control at the record level
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you offer free seats for view-only users?">
We do not offer free seats. Pricing is per user and each user needs a licence to access Twenty.

<Accordion title="Where can I see my credit usage?">

<Accordion title="How many workflow credits do we have?">
The number of credits depends on your billing cycle, not your plan:
- **Monthly subscriptions**: 5 million credits per month
- **Yearly subscriptions**: 50 million credits per year
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does workflow credit consumption work?">
Each workflow action consumes credits based on its complexity:
- **Basic internal operations** (such as search, update, create records) consume very few credits
- **More complex operations** like code nodes and requests to external services consume more credits
- **AI prompts** (coming soon!) will also consume more credits based on usage

Credits are deducted in real-time when workflows execute. You can monitor your usage in **Settings → Billing** to track consumption and remaining credits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I buy more workflow credits?">
You can buy additional credits under `Settings → Billing`.
