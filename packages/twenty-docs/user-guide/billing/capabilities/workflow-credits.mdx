## Overview

Credits power your workflow automations in Twenty. Every workflow action consumes credits based on its complexity.

## Credit Allocation

Credits are based on your billing cycle, not your plan:

| Billing Cycle | Credits |
|---------------|---------|
| Monthly | 5 million/month |
| Yearly | 50 million/year |

<Note>
The 5 million monthly credits are designed to empower you to run automations without worrying about costs. For most workflows using standard actions, this is more than enough. You'll only need additional credits when running advanced code nodes or AI-powered features.
</Note>

## Credit Consumption

Different actions consume different amounts of credits:

| Action Type | Credit Usage |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Basic operations** (search, update, create records) | Minimal |
| **Complex operations** (code nodes, external API calls) | More credits |
| **AI prompts** (coming soon) | Variable based on usage |

Credits are deducted in real-time when workflows execute.
