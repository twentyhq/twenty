## Understanding Pipelines

A sales pipeline tracks opportunities from initial contact to closed deal. Each stage represents a step in your sales process, and opportunities move through these stages as they progress toward closing.

Twenty includes standard sales stages like Prospecting, Qualification, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed. You can customize these stages to match your specific sales process.

## Working with Kanban Views

Kanban views visually map out your pipeline, where each column represents a stage and each card represents an opportunity. Each card shows key information like deal value, close date, and assigned owner at a glance. For complete details: including notes, tasks, meetings, and email history, click on any card to open the full opportunity record.

### Moving opportunities through your pipeline

You can move each opportunity between stages as it progresses through your sales process by dragging and dropping. Hold your click on a card and move it to the next stage.

### Customizing your pipeline stages

You can tailor your pipeline to suit your specific sales process. Stages represent values in a Select Field, so you can add, remove, or rename them as needed.

#### Adding stages

To add a stage, access the Select Field Settings by navigating to Settings → Data Model, selecting your object, and then the field your Kanban board depends on.

#### Removing stages

To remove a stage, hover the stage name or the `⋮` icon, click `Edit from settings` in the Select Field settings, and then click `Delete` next to the relevant stage.

### Customizing the cards

You can configure your Kanban board to display some fields and hide others. To hide a field, click on `Options` on the top right, then on `Fields` to bring up the list of options. Hover the field you want to hide to bring up the `-` button. Click on it to hide the field.

You can also rearrange the order of fields by holding down the field name and dragging it to where you want it.

### Compact view

You can also hide all the fields and get an overview of all the opportunities at a glance. To do so, click on `Options` on the top right and turn on the toggle for `Compact view` after selecting layout in kanban view.

## Advanced pipeline management

### Automation with workflows

Use [Workflows](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/admins/automations-workflows/how-to-build-your-first-workflow) to automate your pipeline:
- **Automatic stage progression**: Move deals based on activities
- **Notifications**: Alert team members of stage changes
- **Task creation**: Generate follow-up tasks for each stage

### Multiple pipelines

You can create different pipelines for various business lines, market segments, or specialized sales teams by creating new views. Each view can show different opportunities with specific filters and stages tailored to your needs. Learn how to create those views in our [View Management](/user-guide/How-To Tutorials/end-users/views-daily-crm-usage/how-to-create-a-new-view) guide.
