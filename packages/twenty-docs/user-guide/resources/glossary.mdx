## API
API (Application Programming Interface) allows you to connect Twenty with other software systems and build custom integrations.

## Command Menu
The Command Menu is a quick-access interface (opened with `Cmd + K` on Mac and `Ctrl + K` on Windows) that lets you perform actions, create records, and navigate your workspace efficiently.

## Company & People
The CRM has two fundamental types of records:
- A `Company` represents a business or organization.
- `People` represent your company's current and prospective customers or clients.

## Custom Fields
Custom Fields are data fields you create to capture information specific to your business needs and processes.

## Data Model
A Data Model is the structure that defines how information is organized in your CRM, including what objects exist, their properties (fields), and how they relate to each other.

## Favorites
Favorites are records you've marked for quick access, appearing in your sidebar for instant navigation to important data.

## Field 
A field refers to a specific area where particular data is stored for an entity.

## Integration 
Integration are built-in tools that allow to link Twenty with other software or systems.

## Kanban
A `Kanban` is a visual way to track your business processes using cards and columns. Each column represents a stage in your process (for example: new, ongoing, won, lost), and you move records through these stages as they progress.

## Object
An Object is a data structure that represents a specific type of entity in your CRM (like People, Companies, or Opportunities). Objects can be standard (built-in) or custom (created by you).

## Opportunities 
Opportunities in Twenty CRM are potential deals or sales with accounts or contacts.

## Record 
A Record indicates an instance of an object, like a specific account or contact.

## Relation Fields
Relation Fields create connections between different objects, allowing you to link records together (like connecting a Person to a Company).

## Standard Fields
Standard Fields are pre-built data fields that come with objects by default and provide common functionality across all workspaces.

## Tasks 
Tasks in Twenty CRM are assigned activities relating to contacts, accounts, or opportunities.

## Views 
You can customize the display of your records using views, setting different filters, layouts and sorting options for each view.

## Webhooks
Webhooks are automated messages sent from Twenty to other applications when specific events occur, enabling real-time data synchronization.

## Workflows
Workflows are automated processes that trigger actions based on specific conditions, helping you automate repetitive tasks and business processes.

## Workspace
A `Workspace` typically represents a company using Twenty. It holds all the records and data that you and your team members add to Twenty.   
It has a single domain name, which is typically the domain name your company uses for employee email addresses.

## Workspace Members
Workspace Members are the Twenty users from your team who have access to your workspace. They can be assigned as owners or assignees for records.
