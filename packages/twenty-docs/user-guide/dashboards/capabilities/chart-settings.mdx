## Accessing Chart Settings

1. Click on any widget to select it
2. The settings panel opens on the right
3. Configure your chart using the sections below

Settings are organized into sections:

- **Data**: What data to pull and how to filter it
- **X axis**: How to group and sort categories (bar/line charts)
- **Y axis**: What to measure and how to display it (bar/line charts)
- **Style**: Colors, labels, and visual options

<Note>
  Some settings only appear when other settings are configured. For example,
  **Date granularity** only appears when you select a date field.
</Note>

## Data Settings

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="database">Source</ChartSettingTitle>

Choose which object to pull data from.

1. Click **Source**
2. Select an object (Opportunities, People, Companies, etc.)

All your standard and custom objects are available. Changing the source resets other settings since field options depend on the selected object.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="filter">Filter</ChartSettingTitle>

Limit which records are included in the chart.

1. Click **Filter**
2. The filter builder opens
3. Click **+ Add filter**
4. Select a field, condition, and value
5. Add more filters as needed

Filters work the same as in table views. Use them to focus on specific segments of your data.

**Example**: Filter opportunities where Stage equals "Won" to show only closed deals.

---

## X Axis Settings

These settings control the horizontal axis of bar and line charts—typically how your data is grouped into categories.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="axis-x">Data on display</ChartSettingTitle>

Select the field to group your data by. This determines the categories shown on the X axis.

**Example**: Select "Stage" to see data grouped by pipeline stage, or "Created date" to see data over time.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="calendar">Date granularity</ChartSettingTitle>

When grouping by a date field, choose the time period for grouping.

| Option              | Groups data by       | Example output                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Day**             | Each calendar day    | Jan 1, Jan 2, Jan 3...                        |
| **Week**            | Calendar weeks       | Week 1, Week 2, Week 3...                     |
| **Month**           | Calendar months      | January, February, March...                   |
| **Quarter**         | Fiscal quarters      | Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4                                |
| **Year**            | Calendar years       | 2023, 2024, 2025                              |
| **Day of week**     | Weekday (aggregated) | Monday, Tuesday... (all Mondays combined)     |
| **Month of year**   | Month (aggregated)   | January, February... (all Januaries combined) |
| **Quarter of year** | Quarter (aggregated) | Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 (all Q1s combined)             |

The "of week/year" options aggregate across all time. Use **Day of week** to see which weekday typically gets the most deals. Use **Month** to see trends month by month.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="arrows-sort">Sort by</ChartSettingTitle>

Control the order of categories on the X axis.

- **Position** – Uses the order defined in your Select field settings
- **Alphabetical** – A to Z (or chronological for dates)
- **By value** – Ordered by the metric (highest or lowest first)
- **Manual** – Drag to set your own order

**Tip**: For pipeline stages, use **Position** to show stages in your sales process order (Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Won).

<Note>
  The options shown depend on your field type. Select fields have all options;
  date and text fields show fewer.
</Note>

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="eye-off">Omit zero values</ChartSettingTitle>

Hide categories that have zero or no data.

- **On**: Categories with no records are hidden
- **Off**: All categories are shown, even if empty

Use this to clean up charts with sparse data.

---

## Y Axis Settings

These settings control what you're measuring and how it's displayed.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="axis-y">Data on display</ChartSettingTitle>

Select the field and operation to calculate your metric.

- **Counts** – Count all, Count empty, Count not empty, Count unique values
- **Math** – Sum, Average, Min, Max (number fields)
- **Percentages** – Percent empty, Percent not empty

Boolean fields add Count true/false. Aggregate charts with date fields show Earliest/Latest.

**Example**: Select "Amount" with Sum to see total deal value per category, or Count all to see number of deals.

<Note>
  The options shown depend on your field and chart type. If you don't see an
  expected operation, check your field type.
</Note>

### Ratio

For Select, Multi-select, or Checkbox fields, you can calculate the percentage of a specific value.

1. Select a Select, Multi-select, or Checkbox field
2. Enable **Ratio**
3. Choose the option to measure

**Example**: Show "Won" deals as a percentage of all opportunities. If you have 10 Won out of 50 total, the chart shows 20%.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="filters">Group by</ChartSettingTitle>

Add a second dimension to create multiple series (multiple bars or lines).

1. Set your X axis field first
2. Click **Group by**
3. Select a second field

**Example**: Group deals by Stage (X axis) AND by Owner (Group by) to see each person's pipeline breakdown side by side.

When Group by is set, you'll see multiple colors in your chart and a legend appears.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="calendar">Date granularity</ChartSettingTitle>

When Group by is a date field, choose the time period (same options as X axis).

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="arrows-sort">Sort by</ChartSettingTitle>

When **Group by** is set, control the order of grouped series (e.g., which owner's bar appears first within each category).

Same options as X axis sorting—Position, Alphabetical, and Manual—except **value-based sorting is not available** for secondary grouping.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="chart-bar-popular">Cumulative</ChartSettingTitle>

Show running totals instead of individual values.

- **Off**: Each bar/point shows its own value
- **On**: Each bar/point shows the sum of all previous values plus its own

**Example**: January = 10, February = 15

- Cumulative off: Shows 10 and 15
- Cumulative on: Shows 10 and 25 (10 + 15)

Use cumulative to track progress toward a goal over time.

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="math-min">Min range</ChartSettingTitle> / <ChartSettingTitle icon="math-max">Max range</ChartSettingTitle>

Set fixed minimum and maximum values for the Y axis.

- Leave blank for automatic scaling
- Enter a number to fix the boundary

**When to use:**

- Set Min to 0 for accurate visual comparisons
- Set both for consistent scales across multiple charts
- Focus on a specific value range by setting both

---

## Style Settings

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="color-swatch">Colors</ChartSettingTitle>

Set the color scheme for your chart. Choose from a variety of color palettes.

<Note>
  When grouping by a Select field, the chart automatically uses the colors
  defined for each option in your field settings.
</Note>

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="gizmo">Axis name</ChartSettingTitle>

Control visibility of axis labels (bar and line charts only).

| Option     | What it shows                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **None**   | No axis labels                 |
| **X axis** | Only the horizontal axis label |
| **Y axis** | Only the vertical axis label   |
| **Both**   | Both axis labels               |

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="stack-2">Stacked bars / Stacked lines</ChartSettingTitle>

When Group by is set, choose how multiple series are displayed.

- **Off (Grouped)**: Series appear side by side. Use when comparing exact values between groups.
- **On (Stacked)**: Series stack on top of each other. Use when showing composition—how parts make up a whole.

**Example**: Deals by stage, grouped by owner

- Grouped: See each owner's exact numbers side by side
- Stacked: See total deals per stage, with each owner's contribution stacked

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="badge-2k">Data labels</ChartSettingTitle>

Show values directly on chart elements (bars, points, slices).

- **On**: Values appear on the chart
- **Off**: No values shown (cleaner look)

### <ChartSettingTitle icon="text-caption">Legend</ChartSettingTitle>

Show or hide the legend (only appears when Group by is set).

- **On**: Legend shows what each color represents
- **Off**: No legend displayed
