## Available Widgets

Twenty provides various widget types to visualize your CRM data.

### Bar Charts
Display data as horizontal or vertical bars.

**Best for:**
- Comparing values across categories
- Showing rankings
- Tracking metrics by time period

**Example uses:**
- Deals by stage
- Revenue by sales rep
- Contacts added per month

<Note>
**Display limits**: Bar charts can show a maximum of 100 bars (horizontal) or 50 bars (vertical). If you see the warning "Undisplayed data: max X bars per chart", add filters to narrow down your data or change the grouping (e.g., group by week instead of days).
</Note>

### Pie Charts
Show proportions of a whole.

**Best for:**
- Showing composition or distribution
- Comparing parts to whole
- Highlighting major segments

**Example uses:**
- Deal distribution by source
- Contact breakdown by industry
- Pipeline composition by owner

### Line Charts
Display trends over time.

**Best for:**
- Tracking changes over time
- Identifying trends
- Comparing multiple metrics

**Example uses:**
- Monthly deal count trend

### Number Metrics
Display single key values prominently.

**Best for:**
- Highlighting KPIs

- Quick status checks

**Example uses:**

- Conversion rate

**Advanced options:**
- **Ratio**: For Select fields, calculate ratios between values. Go to **Data on display** → select your field → enable the **Ratio** option.
- **Prefix & Suffix**: Add custom text before or after the number (e.g., "$" prefix or "%" suffix) for better readability.

### iFrames
Embed external tools and content directly in your dashboard.

**Best for:**

## Visibility & Access

### Dashboard Visibility
Dashboards are visible to everyone who has access to your Twenty workspace. There is no private dashboard option at the moment.

### Favorites
You can add dashboards to your favorites for quick access. This is a personal setting—your favorites are not visible to other users.

### Timezone Behavior

Dashboards currently display data based on the timezone of the user viewing them. This means the same dashboard may show different metrics for team members in different regions (e.g., APAC vs. US).

<Note>
**Coming soon**: We will add the ability to set a specific timezone for a dashboard, so all users see consistent data regardless of their location.
</Note>

<Note>
**Coming soon**: Dashboard-level filters will allow you to apply filters across all widgets at once, making it faster to explore your data.

## Data Refresh

Widgets update automatically as your CRM data changes:
- Real-time updates for most metrics
- Refresh button for manual update
- Historical data preserved for trends
