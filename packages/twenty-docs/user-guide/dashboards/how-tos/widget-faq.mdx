## Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see Sum or Average options?">
    Sum, Average, Min, and Max only work with **number fields**.

    If you've selected a text, date, or select field, these options won't appear. Switch to a number field to use these operations.

    **Available operations by field type:**
    - **Any field**: Count all, Count empty, Count not empty, Count unique, Percent empty, Percent not empty
    - **Number fields**: Sum, Average, Min, Max
    - **Date fields**: Earliest date, Latest date
    - **Checkbox fields**: Count true, Count false
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between grouped and stacked bars?">
    When you add a **Group by** field, you can display multiple series in two ways:

    **Grouped (side by side)**
    - Bars appear next to each other
    - Best for comparing exact values between groups
    - Example: See exactly how many deals each sales rep has per stage

    **Stacked (on top)**
    - Bars stack on top of each other
    - Best for showing composition—how parts make up a whole
    - Example: See total deals per stage, with each rep's contribution shown as a section

    Toggle **Stacked bars** in the Style section to switch between them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I show percentages instead of counts?">
    Three options depending on what you want:

    **Option 1: Percentage of total records**
    - Under **Data on display**, select **Percent empty** or **Percent not empty**
    - Shows what % of records have or don't have a value

    **Option 2: Percentage of a specific option (Ratio)**
    - Select a Select, Multi-select, or Checkbox field
    - Enable **Ratio**
    - Choose the specific option
    - Shows that option as a % of all records

    **Option 3: Add a % suffix (number metrics)**
    - If your data is already in percentage form
    - Add `%` as a **Suffix** in Style settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does cumulative mean?">
    Cumulative shows a **running total**. Each bar or point includes all previous values added together.

    **Example:**
    - January: 10 deals
    - February: 15 deals
    - March: 8 deals

    **Without cumulative:** Shows 10, 15, 8

    **With cumulative:** Shows 10, 25 (10+15), 33 (10+15+8)

    Use cumulative to track progress toward a goal over time, like seeing your year-to-date total grow month by month.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I set a manual sort order?">
    1. Open your widget settings
    2. Find **Sort by** (in X axis or Y axis section)
    3. Select **Manual**
    4. Drag items to reorder them

    Manual sort is useful when you want a specific order that isn't alphabetical or by value—like custom pipeline stages or priority levels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add a secondary grouping?">
    Secondary grouping lets you split data by two dimensions (e.g., deals by stage AND by owner).

    1. Set your **X axis** field (primary grouping)
    2. In the **Y axis** section, click **Group by**
    3. Select a second field

    This creates a multi-series chart. Each group gets its own color, and a legend appears to identify them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Day and Day of week?">
    **Day** groups by specific calendar dates:
    - Jan 1, Jan 2, Jan 3, Jan 4...
    - Shows each individual day

    **Day of week** aggregates all data by weekday:
    - Monday (all Mondays combined), Tuesday (all Tuesdays combined)...
    - Shows patterns across the week

    Use **Day** for trends over time. Use **Day of week** to find which weekday typically performs best.

    The same logic applies to **Month** vs **Month of year** and **Quarter** vs **Quarter of year**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Display

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is my chart showing 'Undisplayed data'?">
    Charts have display limits to keep them readable:

    - **Bar charts (horizontal)**: Maximum 100 bars
    - **Bar charts (vertical)**: Maximum 50 bars

    If your data exceeds this, some bars won't be shown.

    **To fix this:**
    - Add filters to narrow down your data
    - Change date granularity (e.g., from Day to Week or Month)
    - Group by a field with fewer categories
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does my chart look different than my colleague's?">
    Dashboards display data based on the **viewer's timezone**.

    If you're in different regions (e.g., US vs APAC), you may see slightly different numbers for the same dashboard because "today" or "this week" differs by timezone.

    <Note>
    **Coming soon**: We're adding the ability to set a specific timezone per dashboard so all users see consistent data.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I show the total in a pie chart?">
    1. Open your pie chart settings
    2. In the **Style** section, find **Show value in center**
    3. Toggle it on

    The total value (sum of all slices) appears in the center of the pie.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I hide empty slices in a pie chart?">
    1. Open your pie chart settings
    2. In the **Data** section, find **Hide empty category**
    3. Toggle it on

    Slices with zero values are removed, keeping your chart clean.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the same colors across multiple charts?">
    Yes, in two ways:

    **Option 1: Set the same color manually**
    - Open each chart's settings
    - Under **Colors**, select the same color

    **Option 2: Use Select field colors**
    - When grouping by a Select field, the chart automatically uses the colors defined for each option in your field settings
    - These colors stay consistent across all charts that group by that field
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Some settings are grayed out or missing—why?">
    Many settings only appear when prerequisites are met:

    - **Date granularity**: Only appears when you select a date field
    - **Group by**: Only appears after Source is set
    - **Legend toggle**: Only appears when Group by is set
    - **Stacked bars/lines**: Only appears when Group by is set
    - **Sort by (for groups)**: Only appears when Group by is set

    If a setting is missing, check if you need to configure another setting first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My aggregate options changed—what happened?">
    The available aggregate operations depend on the **field type** you select:

    - Select a **number field** → Sum, Average, Min, Max become available
    - Select a **date field** → Earliest date, Latest date become available
    - Select a **checkbox field** → Count true, Count false become available
    - Select a **Select/Multi-select field** → Ratio option becomes available

    When you change fields, the options update to match what's possible for that field type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Colors don't match my Select field options—why?">
    The chart uses Select field colors **only when grouping by that field**.

    If you're grouping by a different field, the chart uses its own color palette.

    To ensure colors match:
    1. Make sure **Group by** (or **Each slice represents** for pie charts) is set to your Select field
    2. Verify colors are defined in your Select field settings (Settings → Data model → [Object] → [Field] → Options)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My chart is empty—what's wrong?">
    Check these common causes:

    1. **No data matches filters**: Remove or adjust filters to include more records
    2. **Wrong source object**: Verify you've selected the correct object in Source
    3. **Date range issue**: If grouping by date, ensure your date range includes records
    4. **Permissions**: Ensure you have access to view the records in the selected object

    Try removing all filters first to see if data appears, then add filters back one by one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I reset all chart settings?">
    There's no single "reset" button, but you can:

    1. Change the **Source** to a different object
    2. Change it back to your original object

    This clears all dependent settings since they're tied to the source object's fields.

    Alternatively, delete the widget and create a new one.
