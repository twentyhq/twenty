<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I show percentages instead of counts?">
    Three options:

    - **Percent empty/not empty**: Under Data on display, select Percent empty or Percent not empty
    - **Ratio**: For Select or Checkbox fields, enable Ratio to show a specific option as a percentage of all records
    - **Suffix**: For aggregate charts, add `%` as a Suffix in Style settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between grouped and stacked bars?">
    When using **Group by**, you can display series two ways:

    - **Grouped**: Bars side by side—best for comparing exact values
    - **Stacked**: Bars on top of each other—best for showing composition

    Toggle **Stacked** in Style settings to switch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I see Sum or Average options?">
    Available operations depend on **field type**:

    - **Number fields**: Sum, Average, Min, Max
    - **Date fields**: Earliest, Latest (aggregate charts only)
    - **Checkbox fields**: Count true, Count false

    If you don't see an option, check that you've selected a compatible field type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are some settings grayed out or missing?">
    Many settings only appear when prerequisites are met:

    - **Date granularity**: Select a date field first
    - **Group by, Legend, Stacked**: Set Source first
    - **Legend, Stacked toggles**: Set Group by first

    If a setting is missing, configure its prerequisite first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'No data' mean?">
    The chart found no records matching your configuration.

    **To fix:** Remove or adjust filters, verify you selected the correct Source object, or check that records exist for your date range.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'Invalid configuration' mean?">
    A required setting is missing or incompatible.

    **To fix:** Ensure Source is set, Data on display is configured, and any required grouping fields are selected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'Undisplayed data' mean?">
    Your data exceeds display limits (100 bars, 100 data points, or 100 slices).

    **To fix:** Add filters to narrow your data, or change date granularity from Day to Week or Month.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is one axis showing no data?">
    The selected field has no values for the records in your filter, or the field type doesn't match the expected data.

    **To fix:** Try a different field, or check that records have values for the selected field.
