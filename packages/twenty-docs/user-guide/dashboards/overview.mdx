## Key Concepts

### Dashboards
A dashboard is a collection of tabs that display your CRM data at a glance. You can create multiple dashboards for different purposes:
- Sales performance
- Team activity
- Pipeline health
- Custom metrics

### Tabs
Tabs allow you to organize your dashboard into sections. Each tab contains one or more widgets.

### Widgets
Widgets are individual visualizations that display specific data. Types include:
- Bar charts
- Pie charts
- Line charts
- Number metrics
- iFrames

<Note>
**Current limitations**:
- Exporting dashboards and sharing with external users (non-Twenty users) are not available at the moment.
- Gauge charts and tables are not yet available.
