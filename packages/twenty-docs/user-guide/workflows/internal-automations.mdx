Below are workflow examples you could roll out to automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual work and keep your data up-to-date.

## Data Management Automations

### Auto-Flag Personal Emails
**Problem**: Your team needs to identify personal vs. business email addresses for better targeting and compliance.

**Solution**: Create a workflow that automatically updates an "is personal email" field whenever an email address is added or updated.

**Trigger**: Record is Updated (People object, Email field)  

**Actions**: 
- Code action to check if email domain matches common personal providers (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.)
- Update Record to set the "is personal email" flag

### Lead Assignment - Round Robin
**Problem**: New leads need to be distributed fairly across your sales team to ensure balanced workloads.

**Solution**: Automatically assign new leads to sales reps using a round-robin system.

**Trigger**: Record is Created (People object)    

**Actions**:
- Search Records to find the last assigned rep
- Code action to determine next rep in rotation
- Update Record to assign the lead to the selected rep
- Send Email to notify the assigned rep

### Lead Assignment - Territory Based
**Problem**: Leads should be assigned based on geographic territories or company characteristics.

**Solution**: Route leads to the appropriate sales rep based on location, company size, or industry.

**Trigger**: Record is Created (People or Companies object)  

**Actions**:
- Code action to determine territory based on location/industry rules

## Sales Process Automations

**Trigger**: Record is Updated (Opportunities object, Stage field = "Closed Won")  

**Actions**:
- Update Record to change Company type from "Prospect" to "Customer"
- Create Record for onboarding tasks assigned to account manager

### Opportunity Stage Management - Closed Lost Renewal
**Problem**: When renewal opportunities are lost, the customer status needs to be updated for proper account management.

**Solution**: Automatically update customer status when renewal deals are lost.

**Actions**:
- Update Record to change Company type from "Customer" to "Churn Customer"
- Create Record for churn analysis task
- Send Email alert to customer success manager
- Update Record to add churn date and reason

### Stale Opportunity Alerts
**Problem**: Opportunities sit without updates, causing deals to go cold and forecasts to become unreliable.

**Solution**: Send automatic alerts when opportunities haven't been updated recently.

**Trigger**: On a Schedule (daily)  

**Actions**:
- Search Records for opportunities not updated in X days
- Code action to format alert message with opportunity details
- Send Email to opportunity owner and manager
- Create Record for follow-up task if no response

## Productivity Automations

**Actions**:
- Create Record for pre-meeting preparation task
- Create Record for post-meeting follow-up task
- Send Email reminder to attendees
- Update Record to link tasks to the meeting

### Cross-Object Field Synchronization
**Problem**: You need information from related records easily accessible (e.g., main contact's email on opportunity record).

**Solution**: Automatically sync fields between related objects until nested fields are available.

**Trigger**: Record is Updated (Opportunities object, Point of Contact field)  

**Actions**:
- Search Records to find the linked person's details
- Update Record to copy email address to opportunity
- Update Record to copy phone number to opportunity

## Data Validation and Cleanup

**Actions**:
