Trigger-based workflows run automatically when specific events occur in your CRM. This guide walks you through creating your first automated workflow.

## Choosing the Right Trigger

| Trigger | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Record is Created** | Process new leads, welcome new contacts |
| **Record is Updated** | React to status changes, field updates |
| **Record is Updated or Created** | Handle both new records and imports |
| **Record is Deleted** | Cleanup tasks, notifications |

## Step-by-Step: Record Created Workflow

### Example: Create Task When New Opportunity Added

**Goal**: Automatically create a follow-up task when a new opportunity is added.

### Step 1: Create the Workflow

1. Go to **Settings → Workflows**
2. Click **+ New Workflow**
3. Name it "New Opportunity - Create Follow-up Task"

### Step 2: Configure the Trigger

1. Click on the trigger block
2. Select **Record is Created**
3. Choose **Opportunities** as the object

### Step 3: Add the Create Record Action

1. Click **+** below the trigger
2. Select **Create Record**
3. Configure:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Object** | Tasks |
| **Title** | Follow up on {{trigger.object.name}} |
| **Assignee** | `{{trigger.object.owner}}` |
| **Due Date** | 3 days from now (use Code action to calculate) |
| **Related Opportunity** | `{{trigger.object.id}}` |

### Step 4: Test and Activate

1. Click **Test** to run with sample data
2. Review the created task
3. Click **Activate** when ready

## Step-by-Step: Record Updated Workflow

### Example: Update Company When Opportunity Stage Changes

**Goal**: When an opportunity moves to "Closed Won", update the company type to "Customer".

### Step 1: Create the Workflow

1. Create a new workflow
2. Name it "Opportunity Won - Update Company Type"

### Step 2: Configure the Trigger

1. Select **Record is Updated**
2. Choose **Opportunities**
3. Under "Fields to monitor", select **Stage**

### Step 3: Add a Filter

1. Click **+** to add a Filter action
2. Condition: `{{trigger.object.stage}}` equals "Closed Won"

### Step 4: Add Update Record Action

1. Add **Update Record** action
2. Configure:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Object** | Companies |
| **Record** | `{{trigger.object.company.id}}` |
| **Type** | Customer |

### Step 5: Test and Activate

1. Test by updating an opportunity to "Closed Won"
2. Verify the company type changed
3. Activate the workflow

## Working with Multiple Actions

### Example: Complete Onboarding Process

**Goal**: When opportunity closes, update company AND create onboarding task AND send email.

```
Trigger: Record Updated (Opportunity, Stage = Closed Won)
    │
    ├── Action 1: Update Company type to "Customer"
    │
    ├── Action 2: Create onboarding task
    │
    └── Action 3: Send welcome email to contact
```

Each action runs in sequence, and data from previous steps is available to later steps.

## Using Branches for Conditional Logic

### Example: Different Actions for Win vs. Loss

```
Trigger: Record Updated (Opportunity, Stage field)
    │
    ├── Branch 1: Filter (Stage = Closed Won)
    │   └── Update Company to "Customer"
    │
    └── Branch 2: Filter (Stage = Closed Lost)
        └── Create "Lost Deal Analysis" task
```

<Note>
Branches run in parallel by default. Use Filter actions at the start of each branch to control which path executes.
</Note>

## Tips for Trigger-Based Workflows

### Avoid Infinite Loops
If your workflow updates a record that could trigger another workflow, be careful:
- Use specific field conditions
- Add filters to prevent re-triggering
- Test thoroughly in draft mode

### Handle Missing Data
Records might be missing expected data:
- Add filters to check for required fields
- Use branches for "found" vs "not found" scenarios
- Provide default values where appropriate

### Test Before Activating
1. Create test records to trigger the workflow
2. Review workflow runs for errors
3. Verify all actions completed correctly
4. Check that data looks as expected
