## How Branches Work

In the workflow editor, you can create multiple paths (branches) going out from a single node. This allows you to build complex automations with different outcomes.

**Important**: When a workflow runs, **all branches execute in parallel by default**. There is no built-in "if/else" logic to choose one branch over another—every path will run simultaneously.

## Controlling Which Branch Runs

To execute only one branch based on specific conditions, **add a Filter node at the beginning of each branch**.

### Example Setup

1. Create your workflow with multiple branches from a single node
2. Add a **Filter** node as the first step in each branch
3. Set conditions on each Filter to determine when that branch should continue
4. Only the branch(es) whose Filter conditions are met will proceed

### How Filters Work

- If the Filter condition is **met**: The branch continues executing
- If the Filter condition is **not met**: The branch stops at the Filter node

This effectively creates conditional logic where only the appropriate branch runs based on your data.

## Example: Route by Deal Size

**Scenario**: When a deal is closed, send different notifications based on deal size.

1. **Trigger**: Opportunity updated (Stage = Closed Won)
2. **Branch 1**: Filter for Amount > $10,000 → Send Slack message to #big-deals
3. **Branch 2**: Filter for Amount ≤ $10,000 → Send email to sales manager

Both branches start, but only the one matching the deal amount will continue past its Filter.

## Best Practices

- Always use **Filter nodes** at the start of branches when you want conditional execution
- Keep branch conditions **mutually exclusive** to avoid duplicate actions
- Test your workflows with different data to ensure the correct branches run
