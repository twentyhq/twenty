Capture leads from your website contact forms, landing pages, or any web form directly into Twenty.

## Does Twenty Have Built-in Forms?

**No**, Twenty doesn't offer a native webform builder. Instead, you connect your existing forms (built with any tool) to Twenty using a **webhook-triggered workflow**.

This approach gives you full flexibility:
- Use any form builder (Typeform, Google Forms, HubSpot, custom HTML, etc.)
- Capture exactly the data you need
- Process submissions with custom logic before creating records

## How It Works

```
Your Website Form → Webhook URL → Twenty Workflow → Create Records
```

1. Build your form with any tool
2. Create a workflow in Twenty with a **Webhook trigger**
3. Configure your form to POST submissions to the webhook URL
4. The workflow creates People, Companies, or any records you need

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create the Workflow

1. Go to **Settings → Workflows**
2. Click **+ New Workflow**
3. Name it (e.g., "Website Contact Form")

### Step 2: Configure the Webhook Trigger

1. Click on the trigger block
2. Select **Webhook**
3. Copy the unique webhook URL provided
4. Define the expected body structure—add the fields your form will send:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "company": "Acme Inc",
  "message": "I'm interested in your product"
}
```

### Step 3: Add Actions to Create Records

1. Add **Create Record** action
2. Select **People** (or your target object)
3. Map the form fields:

| Twenty Field | Form Data |
|--------------|-----------|
| First Name | `{{trigger.body.firstName}}` |
| Last Name | `{{trigger.body.lastName}}` |
| Email | `{{trigger.body.email}}` |
| Company | Search or create based on `{{trigger.body.company}}` |

### Step 4: Connect Your Form

Configure your form tool to send a POST request to the webhook URL:

**HTML Form Example**:
```html
<form action="YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="firstName" placeholder="First Name">
  <input type="text" name="lastName" placeholder="Last Name">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email">
  <input type="text" name="company" placeholder="Company">
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Form Builder Tools**: Most form builders (Typeform, JotForm, Google Forms via Zapier) have a "webhook" or "HTTP request" integration. Paste your Twenty webhook URL there.

### Step 5: Test and Activate

1. Submit a test form entry
2. Check the workflow runs to verify data arrived correctly
3. Activate the workflow

## Advanced: Handle Existing Contacts

To avoid duplicates, check if the contact exists before creating:

1. **Search Records**: Find People where email = `{{trigger.body.email}}`
2. **Filter**: Check if results exist
3. **Branch A** (exists): Update the existing record
4. **Branch B** (new): Create a new record
