Keep related records in sync by automatically copying field values from one object to another. This is useful until nested fields are natively available.

## Common Use Cases

| Source | Destination | Fields to Copy |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Company | Opportunity | Industry, Company Size, ARR |
| Person | Opportunity | Email, Phone, Title |
| Opportunity | Company | Last Deal Amount, Last Won Date |
| Person | Task | Contact Email, Contact Phone |

## Basic Field Copy

### Example: Copy Contact Email to Opportunity

**Goal**: When setting a Point of Contact on an opportunity, copy their email to the opportunity for easy access.

### Setup

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (Opportunities, Point of Contact field)

2. **Filter**: Check that Point of Contact is not empty

3. **Search Records**: Find the linked person
   - Object: People
   - Filter: ID equals `{{trigger.object.pointOfContact.id}}`

4. **Update Record**:
   - Object: Opportunities
   - Record: `{{trigger.object.id}}`
   - Contact Email: `{{searchRecords[0].email}}`
   - Contact Phone: `{{searchRecords[0].phone}}`

## Copy Multiple Fields

### Example: Sync Company Info to All Related Opportunities

**Goal**: When company details change, update all related opportunities.

### Setup

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (Companies)
   - Fields: Industry, Company Size, Annual Revenue

2. **Search Records**: Find all opportunities for this company
   - Object: Opportunities
   - Filter: Company ID equals `{{trigger.object.id}}`

3. **Iterator**: Loop through each opportunity

4. **Update Record** (inside iterator):
   - Object: Opportunities
   - Record: `{{iterator.currentItem.id}}`
   - Company Industry: `{{trigger.object.industry}}`
   - Company Size: `{{trigger.object.companySize}}`
   - Company ARR: `{{trigger.object.annualRevenue}}`

## Copy on Record Creation

### Example: Pre-fill Task with Contact Info

**Goal**: When creating a task linked to a person, copy their contact details.

### Setup

1. **Trigger**: Record is Created (Tasks)
   - Filter: Related Person is not empty

2. **Search Records**: Get the linked person's details
   - Object: People
   - Filter: ID equals `{{trigger.object.relatedPerson.id}}`

3. **Update Record**:
   - Object: Tasks
   - Record: `{{trigger.object.id}}`
   - Contact Email: `{{searchRecords[0].email}}`
   - Contact Phone: `{{searchRecords[0].phone}}`
   - Contact Company: `{{searchRecords[0].company.name}}`

## Bidirectional Sync

### Example: Keep Primary Contact in Sync

**Goal**: When a company's primary contact changes, update the contact. When a person becomes primary, update the company.

### Workflow 1: Company → Person

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (Companies, Primary Contact field)
2. **Update Record**: Set person's "Is Primary Contact" to true
3. **Search Records**: Find previous primary contact
4. **Update Record**: Set previous contact's "Is Primary Contact" to false

### Workflow 2: Person → Company

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (People, Is Primary Contact = true)
2. **Update Record**: Set company's Primary Contact to this person

<Note>
Be careful with bidirectional syncs to avoid infinite loops. Use filters to check if the value actually changed before updating.
</Note>

## Using Code for Complex Mapping

### Example: Transform Data During Copy

**Goal**: Copy and format phone number from person to opportunity.

```javascript
export const main = async (params) => {
  const { phone } = params;

  if (!phone) return { formattedPhone: null };

  // Remove non-numeric characters
  const digits = phone.replace(/\D/g, '');

  // Format as (XXX) XXX-XXXX
  const formatted = digits.length === 10
    ? `(${digits.slice(0,3)}) ${digits.slice(3,6)}-${digits.slice(6)}`
    : phone;

  return { formattedPhone: formatted };
};
```

## Best Practices

### Avoid Loops
- Don't create workflows that trigger each other endlessly
- Use specific field conditions
- Add checks to see if value actually changed

### Handle Missing Data
- Always check if source record exists before copying
- Provide default values for optional fields
- Use filters to skip when source field is empty

### Performance
- Batch updates when copying to many records
- Use scheduled workflows for bulk sync operations
- Consider using Iterator for multiple record updates
