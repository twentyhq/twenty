- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Be mindful of API rate limits - use scheduled workflows when possible
- Consider batch updates "On a Schedule" when real-time processing isn't required
- Remember the 100 concurrent workflow limit per workspace - use "Bulk" availability for manual triggers when processing multiple records
- Test with sample data before activating workflows
