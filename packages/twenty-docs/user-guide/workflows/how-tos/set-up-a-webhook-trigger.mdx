Webhook triggers allow external services to start your workflows by sending data to a unique URL. Use them to connect forms, third-party apps, and custom integrations.

## When to Use Webhooks

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Web forms** | Contact form submissions create leads |
| **Third-party apps** | Stripe payment → create customer record |
| **Custom integrations** | Your app → Twenty automation |
| **No-code tools** | Zapier, Make, n8n connections |

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create the Workflow

1. Go to **Settings → Workflows**
2. Click **+ New Workflow**
3. Name it (e.g., "Website Form Submission")

### Step 2: Configure the Webhook Trigger

1. Click on the trigger block
2. Select **Webhook**
3. You'll receive a unique webhook URL like:
   ```
   https://api.twenty.com/webhooks/workflow/abc123...
   ```
4. Copy this URL—you'll need it for your external service

### Step 3: Define Expected Data Structure

For **POST** requests, define the expected body structure:

1. Click **Define expected body**
2. Enter a sample JSON that matches what your service will send:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "company": "Acme Inc",
  "message": "Interested in your product"
}
```

3. Click **Save**—this creates variables you can use in subsequent steps

### Step 4: Add Actions

Now add actions that use the webhook data:

**Example: Create a Person record**

1. Add **Create Record** action
2. Select **People** object
3. Map fields:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| First Name | `{{trigger.body.firstName}}` |
| Last Name | `{{trigger.body.lastName}}` |
| Email | `{{trigger.body.email}}` |
| Company | Search or create based on `{{trigger.body.company}}` |

### Step 5: Test the Webhook

Before activating, test your webhook:

**Using cURL**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.twenty.com/webhooks/workflow/abc123... \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

**Using Postman or similar**:
1. Create a POST request to your webhook URL
2. Set Content-Type header to `application/json`
3. Add your test JSON body
4. Send and check workflow runs

### Step 6: Activate

Once tested, click **Activate** to make the workflow live.

## Common Webhook Sources

### Website Contact Forms

Connect your website form to Twenty:

1. Set your form's action URL to the webhook URL
2. Ensure form fields match your expected body structure
3. Handle the response appropriately on your website

### Typeform / Google Forms

Use Zapier or Make to connect:
1. Trigger: New form submission
2. Action: Webhook POST to Twenty URL
3. Map form fields to JSON body

### Stripe Payments

1. In Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: your Twenty webhook URL
3. Select events (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`)
4. In Twenty, parse the Stripe event structure

### Calendly Bookings

1. In Calendly → Integrations → Webhooks
2. Add your Twenty webhook URL
3. Select event types (invitee created, etc.)
4. Map booking data to create records

## Handling Different Data Structures

### Nested Data

If your webhook sends nested data:
```json
{
  "contact": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "source": "website"
}
```

Reference with: `{{trigger.body.contact.email}}`

### Arrays

If data includes arrays:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {"name": "Product A", "qty": 2},
    {"name": "Product B", "qty": 1}
  ]
}
```

Use Iterator to loop through: `{{trigger.body.items}}`

## Security Considerations

<Note>
Webhook URLs are unique but not secret. For sensitive integrations, consider:
- Validating the source in a Code action
- Checking for expected headers or signatures
- Using IP allowlisting if your service supports it
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Data Validation
- Add a Code action to validate incoming data
- Check for required fields before creating records
- Handle missing or malformed data gracefully

### Error Handling
- Use filters to check data completeness
- Log errors for debugging
- Consider sending failure notifications

### Testing
- Always test with realistic data before activation
- Check workflow runs after going live
- Monitor for unexpected data formats
