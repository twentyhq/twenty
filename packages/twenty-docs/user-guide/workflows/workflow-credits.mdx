Workflow credits power your automations in Twenty. Understanding how they work helps you optimize costs and manage your automation budget effectively.

## Credit Allocation by Plan

Workflow credits are allocated per workspace based on your subscription plan:

- **Trial**: 5 million credits
- **Pro Plan**: 10 million credits per month
- **Organization Plan**: 20 million credits per month

## How Credit Consumption Works

Credits are consumed when workflows execute, not when you create them. Each workflow action consumes credits based on its complexity:

### Credit Consumption by Action Type

- **Basic internal operations**: Very low credit consumption
  - Search Records
  - Create Record
  - Update Record
  - Delete Record
  - Form actions

- **Complex operations**: Higher credit consumption
  - Code actions (JavaScript execution)
  - HTTP Requests to external services


- **AI features**: Significant credit consumption (coming soon)
  - AI prompts and processing will consume credits based on usage

### Real-Time Deduction

Credits are deducted in real-time as workflows execute. This means:
- Draft workflows don't consume credits
- Only active, running workflows use your credit allocation
- Failed workflows still consume credits for completed steps

## Managing Credits

### Check Credit Usage
1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. View your current credit consumption and remaining balance
3. Monitor usage patterns to optimize your workflows

### Purchasing Additional Credits
If you need more credits beyond your plan allocation:
1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click on the option to purchase additional credits. Packages of different sizes are available.
3. Credits are added to your current balance

## Best Practices

### Efficient Workflow Design
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic actions and add complexity gradually
- **Test in Draft**: Thoroughly test workflows before activation to avoid wasting credits on errors
- **Minimize HTTP Requests**: Use efficient search criteria and combine operations where possible
- **Batch Processing**: Use bulk operations and Iterator actions efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to prevent unnecessary retries
- **Manual Trigger Optimization**: For manual triggers, choose `Bulk` availability to process multiple records in a single workflow run (see [Workflow Features](/user-guide/workflows/workflow-features) for details)

### Action Optimization
- Use basic internal operations when possible (lower credit consumption)
- Optimize Code actions for efficiency
- Consider manual triggers for non-urgent processes
- Batch operations to reduce individual action calls

### Credit Management
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check your credit usage weekly in Settings → Billing
- **Usage Tracking**: Keep track of consumption patterns to avoid unexpected overages
- **Plan Accordingly**: Consider upgrading your plan if you consistently need more credits
- **Workflow Review**: Regularly review high-consumption workflows and deactivate unused ones
- **Strategic Planning**: Plan workflow deployment based on credit availability
