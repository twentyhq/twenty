## Why Workflows Matter

Twenty was built to bring maximum flexibility to its users. Rather than forcing you to adapt your business processes to rigid, pre-built features, workflows enable you to build automations that create the CRM that best supports your unique business use cases.

Workflows are Twenty's in-app feature for building these automations. They give you the building blocks to create exactly what your business needs, when it needs it.

## What can I do with workflows?

We recommend building automations for two main purposes:

1. **Internal automations to facilitate your team's day-to-day**: Reduce the amount of manual entries and repetitive tasks that slow down your team.
2. **Bring data in and out of Twenty**: Connect Twenty via API calls and webhooks to your database and other tools.

## Building Your First Workflow

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow
1. Go to **Settings → Workflows**
2. Click **+ New Workflow**
3. Give your workflow a name

### Step 2: Add a Trigger
Every workflow starts with a trigger. Choose from:
- **Record events**: When a record is created, updated, or deleted
- **Schedule**: Run at specific times (daily, weekly, etc.)
- **Manual**: Triggered by a user action

### Step 3: Add Actions
After your trigger, add one or more actions:
- **Create Record**: Add new records to any object
- **Update Record**: Modify existing record data
- **Search Records**: Find records matching criteria
- **Send Email**: Send emails via your connected account
- **HTTP Request**: Call external APIs

### Step 4: Test and Activate
1. Use the **Test** button to run your workflow with sample data
2. Review the results to ensure it works as expected
3. Toggle the workflow **Active** when ready

## Workflow Best Practices

- **Edit step names**: Rename your workflow steps to clearly describe what each one does. This helps with maintenance and makes it easier to hand off to coworkers
- **Leverage previous step data**: You can use fields from records returned by any previous step in your workflow
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic workflows and add complexity over time as you become more comfortable with the system
- **Plan before building**: Map out your workflow logic before you start building to avoid getting stuck halfway through
- **Use branches wisely**: After a `Search Records` step, create branches to handle both "update existing record" and "create new record" scenarios, then merge the paths back together


## What we're working on
Here are the main items we're working on to improve workflows:
- Loops (Iterator is currently in beta, activate it under Settings → Releases → Lab)
- If / Else step
- AI agent to build workflows on your behalf
