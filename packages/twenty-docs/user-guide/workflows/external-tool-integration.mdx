Below are workflow examples you could roll out to connect Twenty with the rest of your stack.


## Data Ingestion Use Cases

### Webform Submissions
**Problem**: You need to capture leads from website forms, landing pages, or contact forms directly into Twenty.

**Actions**:
- Search Records to check if person/company already exists
- Branch: If exists → Update Record, If not → Create Record
- Create Record for follow-up task assigned to sales rep
- Send Email notification to sales team

### Product Data Synchronization
**Problem**: Your sales team needs visibility into product usage, billing, or feature adoption data stored in your data warehouse.

**Solution**: Regularly sync product data into Twenty to give sellers context about their accounts.

### Lead Scoring Integration

**Trigger**: Record is Updated (People object)  

**Actions**:
- HTTP Request to send lead data to scoring platform

### Invoice Generation

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Bi-directional Sync
**Problem**: You need to keep data synchronized between Twenty and another system in both directions.

**Solution**: Combine scheduled workflows with webhook triggers for real-time sync.

**From Twenty to External System**:

**Trigger**: Record is Updated (any relevant object)  

**Actions**:
- HTTP Request to update external system
- Update Record to track sync status and timestamp

**From External System to Twenty**:

**Trigger**: Webhook (from external system)  

**Actions**:
- Search Records to find matching record
- Update Record with new data from external system
- Create Record for conflict resolution task if needed

### Multi-step Data Processing
**Problem**: Data from external sources needs complex processing before it can be used in Twenty.

**Solution**: Use Code actions for data transformation and validation.

**Trigger**: Webhook or On a Schedule  

**Actions**:
- Code action to validate incoming data format
- Code action to transform data structure
- Code action to apply business rules and calculations
- Search Records to check for duplicates
- Create or Update Record with processed data
- Send Email alert if data quality issues detected

## Implementation Tips
- Store API keys securely in Settings → API & Webhooks
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Be mindful of API rate limits - use scheduled workflows when possible
- Consider batch updates "On a Schedule" when real-time processing isn't required
- Remember the 100 concurrent workflow limit per workspace - use "Bulk" availability for manual triggers when processing multiple records (see [Workflow Features](/user-guide/workflows/workflow-features) for details)
- Test with sample data before activating workflows
