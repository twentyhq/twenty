## About Actions

Actions define what happens after a trigger fires. You can chain multiple actions together to build complex automations.

## Record Actions

### Create a Record
Adds a new record to a selected object.

**Configuration**:
- Select the target object
- Fill out the required and optional fields
- Use data from previous steps to populate fields

**Output**: The newly created record data is available for use in subsequent steps.

### Update Record
Modifies an existing record in a selected object.

**Configuration**:
- Select the target object
- Choose the specific record to update
- Select fields to modify and enter new values

**Output**: The updated record data is available for use in subsequent steps.

### Delete Record
Removes a record from a selected object.

**Configuration**:
- Select the target object
- Choose the specific record to delete

**Output**: The deleted record data remains available for use in subsequent steps.

### Search Records
Finds records within a selected object using filter conditions.

**Configuration**:
- Select the object to search
- Set filter criteria to narrow results
- Configure sorting and limits

**Output**: Returns matching records that can be used in subsequent steps.

**Best Practice**: Use branches after Search Records to handle "found" vs "not found" scenarios.

## Loop Actions

### Iterator
Loops through an array of records returned from a previous step, allowing you to perform actions on each record individually.

**Configuration**:
- Select the array of records from a previous step (e.g., results from Search Records)
- Define the actions to perform on each record in the loop
- Configure the variable name to reference each record in the iteration

**Example**: Search Records returns 5 people, then use Iterator to send an email to each person or update each record individually.

**Note**: Iterator is currently in beta. Activate it under Settings > Releases > Lab.

### Filter
Filters an array of records based on specified conditions, allowing only records that meet the criteria to pass through.

**Configuration**:
- Select the array of records to filter
- Define filter conditions and criteria
- Configure which records should pass through to subsequent steps

**Output**: Returns only the records that match the specified filter conditions.

## Communication Actions

### Send Email
Sends an email from your workflow.

**Prerequisites**: Add an email account in Settings > Accounts

**Configuration**:
- Enter recipient email address
- Set subject line
- Compose message body
- Reference variables from previous steps for personalization

**Note**: Email attachments will be available in Q1 2026.

### Form
Prompts a form during workflow execution to collect user input.

**Configuration**:
- Define input fields with types, labels, and placeholders
- Configure validation rules
- Set form title and description

**Output**: Form responses are available for use in subsequent steps.

<Warning>
Forms are currently designed for manual triggers only. For workflows with other triggers (Record Created, Updated, etc.), forms are only accessible via the workflow run interface, which is not the expected user experience. A notifications center will be released in 2026 to properly support forms in automated workflows.
</Warning>

## Integration Actions

### Code
Runs custom JavaScript within your workflow.

**Configuration**:
- Write JavaScript code in the editor
- Access variables from previous steps
- Return variables for use in subsequent steps
- Test code directly in the step

**Access**: Manage API keys in Settings → API & Webhooks

### HTTP Request
Sends a request to an external API as part of your workflow.

**Configuration**:
- Enter the API endpoint URL
- Select HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Add required headers and values
- Include request body for POST/PUT/PATCH requests
- Provide sample response for structure preview

## Action Best Practices

### Data Flow
- Reference data from previous steps using variables
- Plan your action sequence to ensure data is available when needed
- Use Search Records before Update/Delete to find the right records

### Error Handling
- Anticipate failure scenarios
- Use branches to handle different outcomes
- Test thoroughly before activation

### Performance
- Minimize the number of actions when possible
- Use efficient search criteria
- Batch operations where applicable
