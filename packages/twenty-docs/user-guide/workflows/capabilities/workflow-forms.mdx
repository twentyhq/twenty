## About Forms

Forms allow you to collect user input during workflow execution. They're particularly useful for manual workflows where you need additional information before processing.

## Creating a Form

### Add a Form Action
1. In your workflow, add a new action
2. Select **Form** from the action list
3. Configure the form fields

### Form Configuration
- **Title**: Give your form a clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: Add instructions or context for users
- **Fields**: Define the input fields you need

## Field Types

Forms support various field types:

| Field Type | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Text | Single line text input | Names, short answers |
| Long Text | Multi-line text area | Comments, descriptions |
| Number | Numeric input | Quantities, amounts |
| Date | Date picker | Deadlines, dates |
| Select | Dropdown selection | Status, category |
| Checkbox | Boolean true/false | Confirmations |

## Configuring Fields

For each field, you can set:
- **Label**: The field name shown to users
- **Placeholder**: Helper text inside the field
- **Required**: Whether the field must be filled
- **Default Value**: Pre-populated value

## Using Form Data

After a user submits a form:
1. The form data becomes available as variables
2. Reference these variables in subsequent actions
3. Use the data to create records, send emails, etc.

### Example
A form collects:
- Customer name
- Issue description
- Priority level

The next action creates a support ticket using this data.

## Current Limitations

<Warning>
Forms are currently designed for manual triggers only. For workflows with other triggers (Record Created, Updated, etc.), forms are only accessible via the workflow run interface, which is not the expected user experience.

A notifications center will be released in 2026 to properly support forms in automated workflows.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Form Design
- **Keep it simple**: Only ask for necessary information
- **Clear labels**: Use descriptive field names
- **Logical order**: Arrange fields in a natural sequence
- **Required wisely**: Only mark truly required fields

### User Experience
- **Provide context**: Use the description to explain why you need the information
- **Default values**: Pre-fill when you can predict the answer
- **Validation**: Use field types to validate input format

### Integration
- **Map data carefully**: Ensure form fields match your record fields
- **Handle missing data**: Plan for optional fields being empty
- **Test thoroughly**: Submit test forms before activation
