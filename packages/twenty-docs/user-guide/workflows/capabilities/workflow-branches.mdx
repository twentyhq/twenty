description: Create parallel paths and conditional logic in your workflows.

Branches allow you to split your workflow into multiple paths that can run simultaneously or conditionally based on your data.

## How Branches Work

When you create multiple connections from a single node, each path becomes a **branch**. By default, **all branches execute in parallel**—they don't wait for each other.

```
          ┌─→ Branch A (runs immediately)
Trigger ──┼─→ Branch B (runs immediately)
          └─→ Branch C (runs immediately)
```

## Creating Branches

### Add a New Branch

1. Hover over a node in your workflow
2. Click the **+** button on the right side of the node
3. Select the action for your new branch
4. Repeat to add more branches from the same node

<Note>
Each branch is independent. Adding a branch doesn't affect other existing paths from that node.
</Note>

### Visual Layout

Branches appear as parallel paths in the workflow editor. You can drag nodes to rearrange the visual layout without affecting execution.

## Controlling Branch Execution

Since all branches run by default, use **Filter** nodes to control which paths actually execute:

```
                ┌─→ Filter (Stage = "Won") → Send congratulations email
Trigger ────────┼─→ Filter (Stage = "Lost") → Create follow-up task
(Stage changed) └─→ Filter (Stage = "Negotiation") → Notify manager
```

### Setting Up Conditional Branches

1. Create branches from your trigger or action
2. Add a **Filter** node as the first step of each branch
3. Configure each filter with mutually exclusive conditions
4. Add your actions after each filter

Only the branch(es) where the filter condition is met will continue executing.

## Merging Branches

**Branches don't automatically merge.** Each branch runs independently until it ends.

If you need actions to run after multiple branches complete:
- Currently, you'll need to design your workflow so each branch handles its own follow-up actions
- A "wait for all branches" merge capability is on our roadmap

## Parallel vs Sequential Execution

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Multiple branches** | Run in parallel (simultaneously) |
| **Actions within a branch** | Run sequentially (one after another) |
| **Branches with filters** | Only matching branches continue |

## Best Practices

1. **Use filters for conditional logic**: Don't rely on branches alone—add filters to control execution
2. **Keep branches focused**: Each branch should handle one specific scenario
3. **Name your nodes**: Use descriptive names so it's clear what each branch does
4. **Test each path**: Verify that each branch works correctly with test data
5. **Watch for duplicates**: If all branches run, make sure you're not creating duplicate records or sending duplicate emails

## Example: Lead Routing

Route new leads to different teams based on company size:

```
New Lead Created
    │
    ├─→ Filter (Employees > 500) → Assign to Enterprise Team → Send enterprise welcome
    │
    ├─→ Filter (Employees 50-500) → Assign to Mid-Market Team → Send standard welcome
    │
    └─→ Filter (Employees < 50) → Assign to SMB Team → Send SMB welcome
```
