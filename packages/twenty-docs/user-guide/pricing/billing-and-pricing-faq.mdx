## Pricing

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I use Twenty for free while self-hosting?">
Yes, you can use Twenty for free while self-hosting. You will get access to everything included in the (cloud) Pro subscription, except the support from our core-team. Support is accessible via our Discord community.

If you want to self-host and have access to the features included in the (cloud) Organization subscription, including support from our core-team, you can do so by choosing the paid Organization licences, available in self-hosting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you offer free seats for view-only users?">
We do not offer free seats. Pricing is per user and each user needs a licence to access Twenty.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many workflow credits do we have?">
The number of credits varies based on the plan. A workspace under **trial gets 5 million credits**, one with a **Pro plan gets 10 million credits per month** and one with an **Organization plan gets 20 million credits per month**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does workflow credit consumption work?">
Each workflow action consumes credits based on its complexity:
- **Basic internal operations** (such as search, update, create records) consume very few credits
- **More complex operations** like code nodes and requests to external services consume more credits
- **AI prompts** (coming soon!) will also consume more credits based on usage

Credits are deducted in real-time when workflows execute. You can monitor your usage in **Settings → Billing** to track consumption and remaining credits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I buy more workflow credits?">
You can buy additional credits under `Settings → Billing`.
