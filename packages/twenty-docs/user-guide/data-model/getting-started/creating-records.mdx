## What is a Data Model?

A data model is the structure that defines how information is organized in your CRM. It determines:
- **What objects exist** — like Companies, People, or Opportunities
- **What properties they have** — those are the fields
- **How they relate to each other** — the connections between objects

Think of it as the **map of your customer data**.

**An analogy:**
| Data Model Concept | Real-World Analogy |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Objects** | Sections in a book (the categories) |
| **Fields** | Subsections (the properties/attributes) |
| **Records** | Individual articles (the actual content) |

You design the data model (objects + fields) once, then create many records within that structure.

## Why Customize Your Data Model?

Every business works differently. Customizing your data model means you can shape Twenty around **your** processes instead of forcing yours into a rigid system.

Twenty offers full flexibility:
- Create as many custom objects as you need
- Add unlimited custom fields
- The price doesn't change based on customization

## Tips to Design Your Data Model

### 1. Start with Your Core Objects

Identify the main concepts you work with. Twenty already provides:
- **People** — your contacts
- **Companies** — your accounts
- **Opportunities** — your deals

Think about what else you might need:
- Stripe would need a `Subscriptions` object
- Airbnb would need a `Trips` object
- An accelerator would need a `Batches` object

### 2. Use Fields for Variations, Not New Objects

If something is just a characteristic of an existing object, make it a **field**.

**Use fields for:**
- Categories and labels (e.g., `Industry` for Companies)
- Status values (e.g., `Stage` for Opportunities)
- Attributes and properties

### 3. Create an Object When It Stands on Its Own

If the concept has its own lifecycle, properties, or relationships, it deserves an object.

**Create an object for:**
- **Projects** — have deadlines, owners, and tasks
- **Subscriptions** — connect companies, products, and invoices
- **Events** — involve attendees and follow-up actions

These go beyond a single field because they carry their own data and relationships.

### 4. Create an Object When Records Are Open-Ended

If something can be linked multiple times and you don't know how many, use an object.

**Bad approach:**
Creating fields like `Product 1`, `Product 2`, `Product 3`...

**Good approach:**
Create a `Products` object and relate it to records. This supports one, two, or a hundred products without changing your model.

### 5. Keep It Simple First

Start with fields. Move to new objects only when you feel the limits:
- Too many fields on one object
- Repeated records that should be separate
- Relationships that don't fit neatly

## Special Note on People, Companies, and Opportunities

<Warning>
**Email and calendar sync only works with People, Companies, and Opportunities.**

These are the only objects where you can access synchronized emails and meetings from your mailbox/calendar. We recommend using them as much as possible.
</Warning>

**Best practices:**
- If you need categories of People, use fields (not new objects)
- Example: Use a `Person Type` field with values "Prospect" and "Partner" instead of creating separate objects
- Create different **views** to filter: one showing partners, another showing prospects

**It's okay to have fields that don't apply to every record.** For example, a `Referral Link` field on People that only applies when `Person Type = Partner`. Hide this field from views where it's not relevant.

## Questions to Guide Your Choice

Ask yourself:

<Check>Is this just a property of something I already have, or does it need its own properties?</Check>
<Check>Will I ever need to track multiple of these per record, without knowing how many?</Check>
<Check>Does this concept connect to several different objects, not just one?</Check>
<Check>Will it have its own lifecycle (stages, start/end dates)?</Check>

If the answer is "yes" to one or more, it's probably time for a new object.

## Accessing Your Data Model

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Data Model**
3. View all your objects (standard and custom)
4. Click any object to see and edit its fields

<Note>
**Don't see Data Model in Settings?**

Access to the data model is usually restricted to administrators. Contact your workspace admin if you need access.
