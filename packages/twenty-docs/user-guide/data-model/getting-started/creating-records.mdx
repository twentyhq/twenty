2. Click the **+ New** button at the top right
3. Fill in the record details
4. Click **Save**

### From the Command Palette
1. Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows)
2. Type "Create" followed by the object name
3. Select the option (e.g., "Create Person")

### From Related Records
When viewing a Company record, you can create linked People or Opportunities directly:

2. Navigate to the related tab (People or Opportunities)
3. Click **+ Add** to create a linked record

## Editing Records

### Soft Delete
By default, deleted records are moved to a "trash" state:

## Best Practices

- **Fill key fields first**: Focus on the most important fields when creating records
- **Use relations**: Link records together to build a complete picture
- **Consistent naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for better organization
- **Regular cleanup**: Periodically review and clean up duplicate or outdated records
