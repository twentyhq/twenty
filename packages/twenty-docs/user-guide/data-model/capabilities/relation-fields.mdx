## About Relation Fields

Relation fields connect records from different objects together. They're essential for building a connected data model where you can see relationships between your data.

## Types of Relations

### One-to-Many
One record in Object A can be linked to many records in Object B.

**Example:** One Company can have many People (contacts).

### Many-to-One
Many records in Object A can be linked to one record in Object B.

**Example:** Many People can belong to one Company.

### Many-to-Many
Many records in Object A can be linked to many records in Object B.

**Example:** Many People can be linked to many Projects, and vice versa.

## Creating a Relation Field

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the object where you want to add the relation
3. Click **+ Add Field**
4. Select **Relation** as the field type
5. Choose the target object to relate to
6. Configure the relation settings:
   - Relation name
   - Relation type (one-to-many, many-to-one)
7. Click **Save**

## Standard Relations

Twenty comes with pre-built relations between standard objects:

| From Object | To Object | Relation Type |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| People | Companies | Many-to-One |
| Opportunities | Companies | Many-to-One |
| Tasks | People | Many-to-One |
| Notes | People | Many-to-One |

## Using Relations in Views

### In Table View
- Relation fields appear as columns
- Click on a related record to open it
- Filter by related records

### In Record Detail
- Related records appear in tabs
- Add or remove related records
- Navigate between related records

## Best Practices

### Planning Relations
- **Map your data model**: Plan relations before creating them
- **Consider direction**: Think about which object "owns" the relationship
- **Avoid circular dependencies**: Keep your data model clean

### Naming Relations
- **Use clear names**: Make it obvious what the relation represents
- **Be consistent**: Use similar naming patterns across relations
- **Consider both sides**: Name both sides of the relation appropriately

### Performance
- **Don't over-relate**: Too many relations can slow down your workspace
- **Use indexes**: Relations with many records benefit from proper indexing

## Limitations

- **Relation names cannot be changed** after creation (this affects the API)
- **Deleting relations** removes the link but not the related records
- **Circular relations** should be avoided for data integrity
