## Object Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I reorder objects in the left navigation bar?">
Not yet. Object ordering in the navigation is currently fixed, but this feature is planned for a future release.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I hide objects from the left navigation bar?">
All active objects appear in the navigation. You can deactivate objects you don't need under **Settings → Data Model**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I delete standard objects (People, Companies, etc.)?">
You can deactivate any standard objects but you cannot hard delete them.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Field Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I create formula fields?">
Formula fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. In the meantime, you can use workflows to calculate and update field values automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have nested fields in my objects?">
Nested fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. Currently, you can use workflows to bring field values from related objects. For example, to display a company's industry on a Person record, create a custom field on People and use a workflow to synchronize the value.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I update relation field names?">
Relation field names impact the API structure and cannot be changed after creation. If you need to rename a relation field, you'll need to create a new one and delete the old one.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I need different singular and plural names?">
Our GraphQL API uses both forms for different operations:
- `createPerson` (singular) for single record actions
- `createPeople` (plural) for bulk operations

This creates limitations when singular and plural forms are the same, but it improves the developer experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are some field names protected?">
Certain field names like `Type` or `Application` are reserved for system use. Choose alternative names like `Category` or `Classification` instead.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Features

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I create many-to-many relationships?">
Many-to-many relationships are coming in **Q1 2026**. Currently, create an intermediate object with two 1-to-many relationships as a workaround.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Morph Many relationships?">
Morph Many relationships (coming **Q4 2025**) allow one object to relate to multiple different object types. For example, an Opportunity could relate to either a Person or a Company.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I reorder fields in objects?">
Field reordering will be available with custom layouts in **Q4 2025**. Currently, fields appear in the alphabetical order.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Access and Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Where can I see and edit my data model?">
You can access your Data Model under **Settings → Data Model**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I see the Data Model under Settings?">
Reach out to your workspace administrator. Data model access is usually restricted to administrators only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many custom objects or fields can I create?">
You can create as many custom objects and fields as you need - the price won't change.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
