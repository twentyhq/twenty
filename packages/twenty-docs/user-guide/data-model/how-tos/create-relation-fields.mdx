Relation fields connect records from different objects—for example, linking People to Companies.

<Note>
**Relation names cannot be changed after creation** (they affect the API). Plan your names carefully.
</Note>

## Before You Start

Decide:
- Which objects are you connecting? (e.g., People → Companies)
- Which is the "one" side? (e.g., Company)
- Which is the "many" side? (e.g., People — many people work at one company)
- What should the field be named on each side?

See [Relation Fields](/user-guide/data-model/capabilities/relation-fields) for relation types explained.

## Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the object where you want the relation (typically the "many" side)
3. Click **+ Add Field**
4. Select **Relation** as the field type
5. Choose the **target object**
6. Select **One-to-Many** or **Many-to-One**
7. Enter field names for **both sides** of the relation
8. Click **Save**

## Example: People → Companies

- Go to **Settings → Data Model → People**
- Add a Relation field
- Target: **Companies**
- Type: **Many-to-One**
- Field on People: **Company**
- Field on Companies: **Employees**

Now each Person can be linked to a Company, and each Company shows its People.

## Deleting a Relation

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Find the relation field
3. Click **⋮ → Deactivate**

Links are preserved but hidden. Reactivate to restore.

<Note>
**Deleting a relation doesn't delete records.** Only the link between them is removed.
</Note>
