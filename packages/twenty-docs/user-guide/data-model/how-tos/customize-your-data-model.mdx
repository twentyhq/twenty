## Planning Your Data Model

Before making changes, consider:
- What information do you need to track?
- How do different data types relate to each other?
- Who needs access to what information?

## Creating a Custom Object

### When to Create a Custom Object
Create custom objects when you need to track:
- Entities unique to your business (e.g., Projects, Products, Tickets)
- Information with its own lifecycle
- Data that needs relations to other objects

### Steps
1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Click **+ New object**
3. Enter the singular and plural names
4. Choose an icon
5. Add a description
6. Click **Save**

Your new object appears in the sidebar immediately.

## Adding Custom Fields

### Steps
1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the object to customize
3. Click **+ Add Field**
4. Choose field type
5. Enter field name and description
6. Configure field settings
7. Click **Save**

### Quick Method
1. Open any object table view
2. Click the **+** button in the header
3. Select **Customize fields**
4. You're taken directly to Data Model settings

## Creating Relations

### Steps
1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the source object
3. Click **+ Add Field**
4. Select **Relation** as field type
5. Choose the target object
6. Configure relation type
7. Click **Save**

### Relation Types
- **One-to-Many**: One record links to many (e.g., Company → People)
- **Many-to-One**: Many records link to one
- **Many-to-Many**: Multiple records on both sides

## Deactivating Objects or Fields

### When to Deactivate
- Object/field is no longer needed
- Simplifying the interface
- Testing changes

### Steps
1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Find the object or field
3. Click the toggle to deactivate
4. Data is preserved but hidden

### Reactivating
1. Look for grayed-out items in Data Model
2. Click the toggle to reactivate
3. All data is restored

## Best Practices

### Naming
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Follow consistent conventions
- Consider how names appear in the UI

### Organization
- Start with standard objects
- Add custom objects only when needed
- Keep field counts manageable

### Planning
- Document your data model
- Plan relations before creating them
- Test changes in a development workspace first
