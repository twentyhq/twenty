## How Email Integration Works

Twenty automatically links emails from your connected mailboxes to the relevant CRM records, keeping all communication history in one place.

### Where to Find Emails

Email conversations appear in three main objects:

- **People**: View all emails exchanged with a specific contact
- **Companies**: See all emails related to a company and its employees
- **Opportunities**: Access email threads related to the company linked to this opportunity. Email threads from individual people on the opportunity are not shown yet.

### Viewing Email Threads

1. **Navigate to a Record**: Go to any Person, Company, or Opportunity record
2. **Select the Emails Tab**: Click on the `Emails` tab to view synced emails
3. **Open an Email Thread**: Click on any email to open and read the full conversation
4. **Browse History**: Scroll through the complete email history with that contact

## What You'll See

### Email Thread View
When you open an email thread, you can:
- **Read Full Conversations**: See the complete email exchange
- **View Participants**: See all people involved in the email thread
- **Check Timestamps**: Know exactly when each email was sent
- **Access Context**: Understand the full communication history

### Email Visibility
Depending on your mailbox settings, you might see:
- **Full Content**: Complete email text and details
- **Subject + Metadata**: Subject line, sender, recipient, and timestamp
- **Metadata Only**: Basic information without email content

## Email Sync Behavior

### What Gets Synced
- **External Emails**: All emails with contacts outside your organization
- **Automatic Linking**: Emails connect to existing People and Company records
- **Multiple Addresses**: Emails from any address link to the same contact record
- **Updates**: New emails appear within 5 minutes

### What Doesn't Get Synced
- **Internal Emails**: Emails between colleagues (same domain) remain private
- **Group Emails**: Distribution lists and group emails are excluded
- **Excluded Folders**: Folders you've chosen not to sync (configured under Settings → Accounts → Email)

### Selective Folder Sync (Lab Feature)
Control which email folders sync with Twenty:
1. Enable `Message Folder` in Settings → Releases → Lab
2. Configure folders under Settings → Accounts → Email
3. Choose specific folders to include or exclude (Inbox, Sent, Archive, custom folders)


## Troubleshooting Email Sync

### Common Sync Issues
- **Sync Delays**: Emails appear within 5 minutes, but initial imports take longer
- **Missing Emails**: Check if:
  - Folders are excluded in Message Folder settings
  - Contact auto-creation is disabled (emails need existing Twenty records)
  - Email is from colleagues (same domain) or group lists
  - Mailbox is still completing initial sync

### Email Limitations
- **System Folders**: Some email folders may not be available for sync
- **Aliases**: Only true mailboxes can be connected (not email aliases)


## Calendar Integration

### Calendar Tab
Next to the Emails tab, you'll find a `Calendar` tab that contains the history of meetings scheduled with the record.

**Available for:**
- **People**: View all meetings scheduled with a specific contact
- **Companies**: See all meetings related to a company and its employees
- **Opportunities**: Access meeting history related to the company linked to this opportunity

**Visibility Settings**: Calendar data follows the same visibility settings as emails, ensuring consistent privacy controls across both communication channels.

### Viewing Meeting History
1. **Navigate to a Record**: Go to any Person, Company, or Opportunity record
2. **Select the Calendar Tab**: Click on the `Calendar` tab next to the Emails tab
3. **Browse Meeting History**: View all scheduled meetings and their details
4. **Access Meeting Context**: See meeting participants, times, and related information
