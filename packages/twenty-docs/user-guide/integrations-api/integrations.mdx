## Current Integration Options

### Native Integrations
Twenty currently offers native integration with:
- **Email & Calendar**: Connect Gmail, Outlook, or SMTP/CalDAV providers
- **API Access**: Use our REST and GraphQL APIs to build custom integrations

For email and calendar setup, visit [Email & Calendar Setup](/user-guide/section/settings/email-calendar-setup).

### Workflows (Recommended)
The primary way to connect Twenty to other tools is through our in-app **Workflows** feature:
- **HTTP Nodes**: Make API calls to external services
- **Code Nodes**: Write custom logic for complex integrations
- **Webhook Triggers**: Receive data from external systems
- **Field Update Triggers**: Automate actions based on CRM changes

Learn more in our [Workflows section](/user-guide/section/workflows/getting-started-workflows).

### Zapier Integration (Legacy)
We maintain a Zapier integration for users who prefer no-code automation:

1. Visit [Twenty on Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/twenty/integrations)
2. Create a new Zap with Twenty as trigger or action
3. Generate an API key in Settings â†’ API & Webhooks
4. Connect your Twenty workspace to Zapier

## Future Vision: Community-Built Connectors (2026)

### Extensibility Platform
We're building an extensibility platform that will allow developers to create apps as code. This will enable:
- **Custom Connectors**: Build integrations with your favorite software
- **Community Contributions**: Share and discover connectors built by others
- **Flexible Architecture**: Extend Twenty's capabilities beyond core features

### AI-Assisted Workflow Building
Coming in 2026, AI assistance will help users:
- **Auto-Generate Workflows**: Describe your integration needs in plain language
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get recommendations for connecting your specific tools
- **Template Library**: Access pre-built workflows for common use cases

The future of Twenty integrations is community-driven, AI-assisted, and infinitely extensible.
