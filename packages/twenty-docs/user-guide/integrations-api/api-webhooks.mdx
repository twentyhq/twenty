## API Keys

API keys allow automated access to your CRM data, synchronize data with other systems, and create custom integrations or solutions. 

### Create an API Key

1. Go to **Settings → APIs & Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Create key** at the top right
3. Configure your API key:
   - **Name**: Give your API key a descriptive name
   - **Expiration Date**: Set when the key should expire
4. Click **Save** to generate your API key
5. **Important**: Copy and store your API key immediately, it's only shown once

Once created, your API key provides access to your custom API documentation and playground where you can test endpoints with your actual data model. 

<Warning>
Since your API key gives access to sensitive information, you shouldn't share it with services you don't fully trust. If leaked, someone can use it maliciously. If your API key's security is compromised, immediately disable it and generate a new one.

### Manage API Keys

**Regenerate an API Key:**
1. Go to **Settings → APIs & Webhooks**
2. Click on the API key you want to regenerate
3. Click the **Regenerate** button
4. Copy and store the new API key immediately

**Delete an API Key:**
1. Find the API key in your list
2. Click on the key to open its details
3. Click **Delete** to remove it permanently

## Webhooks

Webhooks allow for immediate updates to your specified URL about changes or events related to your customer data.

For example, when an Opportunity moves to "Closed Won", a webhook can automatically trigger invoice creation in your accounting system. Note that this type of automation can also be achieved using Twenty's in-app [Workflows feature](/user-guide/workflows/getting-started-workflows), which offers triggers based on field updates for internal automation.

Webhooks are ideal for integrating with external systems, while Workflows support both internal automation and external tool connections via webhook triggers, code nodes, and HTTP nodes.

### Create a Webhook

1. Go to **Settings → APIs & Webhooks → Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Create webhook**
3. Enter your webhook URL (where you want to receive notifications)
4. Click **Save**

Your webhook will immediately start receiving real-time notifications about changes to your CRM data.
