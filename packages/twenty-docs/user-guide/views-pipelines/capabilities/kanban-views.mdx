## About Kanban Views

Kanban views visually map out process flows, where each column stands for a distinct stage and each card represents a record.

## Move Cards between Stages

You can move each card between stages as it goes through your workflow by dragging and dropping. To proceed, hold your click on a card and move it to the next stage.

## Add and Delete Stages

You can tailor your workflow to suit your needs using stages, which represent a value in a Select Field:

### Add Stages

To add a stage, access the Select field settings by navigating to Settings > Data Model, selecting your object, and then the field your Kanban board depends on.

### Remove Stages

To remove a stage, hover the stage name or the `⋮` icon, click `Edit from settings` in the Select field settings, and then click **Delete** next to the relevant stage.

## Display Fields

You can configure your Kanban board to display some fields and hide others. To hide a field, click on **Options** on the top right, then on **Fields** to bring up the list of options. Hover the field you want to hide to bring up the `-` button. Click on it to hide the field.

You can also rearrange the order of fields by holding down the field name and dragging it to where you want it.

## Compact View

You can also hide all the fields and get an overview of all the opportunities at a glance. To do so, click on **Options** on the top right and turn on the toggle for **Compact view** after selecting layout in Kanban view.

## When to Use Kanban Views

Kanban views are ideal for:
- **Sales pipelines**: Track deals through stages from lead to close
- **Project management**: Monitor tasks through workflow states
- **Recruitment**: Track candidates through hiring stages
- **Any staged process**: Visualize any workflow with defined stages

## Best Practices

### Organize Your Stages
- **Limit stages**: 5-7 stages is ideal for visibility
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive stage names
- **Logical order**: Arrange stages in process order

### Optimize Card Display
- **Show key fields**: Display only the most important information
- **Use compact view**: For high-level overviews
- **Color coding**: Use stage colors to quickly identify status

### Maintain Data Quality
- **Update regularly**: Keep cards moving through stages
- **Archive completed**: Move closed items out of active view
- **Review stale cards**: Follow up on cards stuck in stages
