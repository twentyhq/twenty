## Filtering Data

Filters help you focus on specific records by showing only those that match your criteria.

### Adding a Filter
1. Click the **Filter** button in the view toolbar
2. Select the field to filter by
3. Choose the filter operator (equals, contains, etc.)
4. Enter the filter value
5. Click **Apply**

### Filter Operators

| Field Type | Available Operators |
|------------|---------------------|
| Text | Equals, Contains, Starts with, Ends with, Is empty |
| Number | Equals, Greater than, Less than, Between, Is empty |
| Date | Equals, Before, After, Between, Is empty |
| Select | Equals, Is any of, Is empty |
| Checkbox | Is true, Is false |
| Relation | Equals, Is empty |

### Multiple Filters
Combine multiple filters to narrow down results:
- All filters are applied with AND logic by default
- Each additional filter further restricts the results

### Removing Filters
- Click the **X** on individual filter chips to remove them
- Click **Clear all** to remove all filters

## Sorting Data

Sorting determines the order in which records appear.

### Adding a Sort
1. Click the **Sort** button in the view toolbar
2. Select the field to sort by
3. Choose ascending (A-Z, 0-9) or descending (Z-A, 9-0)
4. Click **Apply**

### Multiple Sorts
Add multiple sort levels for more precise ordering:
- First sort is primary
- Subsequent sorts apply within groups of equal values

### Default Sort
Each view can have a default sort that's applied automatically when opening the view.

## Saving Filter and Sort Settings

### Save to View
After configuring filters and sorts:
1. Click **Save** to update the current view
2. Or click **Save as new view** to create a variant

### View Presets
Create multiple views with different filter/sort configurations:
- "My Open Deals" - filtered to your opportunities in active stages
- "Closing This Month" - filtered by close date
- "High Value" - sorted by deal amount descending

## Quick Filters

### Search Bar
Use the search bar for quick text searches across all visible fields.

### Column Sorting
Click on any column header to quickly sort by that field:
- First click: Ascending
- Second click: Descending
- Third click: Remove sort

## Best Practices

### Effective Filtering
- **Start broad**: Begin with fewer filters and add as needed
- **Use saved views**: Save commonly used filter combinations
- **Clear filters**: Remember to clear filters when done

### Efficient Sorting
- **Primary field first**: Sort by the most important field
- **Consistent ordering**: Use the same sort across related views
- **Date sorting**: Sort by most recent for activity tracking
