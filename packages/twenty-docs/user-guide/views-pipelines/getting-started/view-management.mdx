## Understanding Views

Views are saved configurations that determine how your data is displayed. Each view can have its own:
- **Layout**: Table, Kanban, or Calendar
- **Filters**: Which records to show
- **Sorting**: How records are ordered
- **Fields**: Which columns are visible

## View Types

### Table View
The default spreadsheet-like view showing records in rows with customizable columns.

### Kanban View
A visual board view where records appear as cards organized by stages. Ideal for:
- Sales pipelines
- Project tracking
- Any workflow with defined stages

### Calendar View
Display records with date fields on a calendar. Perfect for:
- Meetings and events
- Deadlines and due dates
- Time-based planning

2. Click on **+ Add view** or the view dropdown

## Managing Views
