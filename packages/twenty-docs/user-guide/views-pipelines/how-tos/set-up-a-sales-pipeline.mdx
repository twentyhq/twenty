A sales pipeline in Twenty is a Kanban view of your Opportunities object, where each column represents a stage in your sales process.

## Step 1: Configure Your Stages

Stages are defined in the Opportunities object's **Stage** field.

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select **Opportunities**
3. Find and click the **Stage** field
4. Add, remove, or rename stages to match your process

### Recommended Stages

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **New** | Fresh opportunities just identified |
| **Qualified** | Confirmed as a good fit |
| **Meeting** | Engaged in discussions |
| **Proposal** | Proposal sent |
| **Negotiation** | Working on terms |
| **Closed Won** | Deal successful |
| **Closed Lost** | Deal unsuccessful |

<Note>
**5-7 stages is optimal.** Too many stages makes the pipeline hard to scan; too few loses visibility into deal progress.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create a Pipeline View

1. Go to **Opportunities**
2. Click the view dropdown → **+ Add view**
3. Name it "Sales Pipeline"
4. Click **Create**
5. Open **Options** and select **Kanban** as the layout

The view automatically uses the Stage field for columns.

## Step 3: Configure Your View

### Show Key Fields
1. Click **Options → Fields**
2. Look for fields in the "Hidden Fields" section
3. Click the **eye icon** to display: Company, Amount, Close Date, Owner

### Enable Aggregations
Show totals at the top of each column:
1. Click the number displayed next to a Stage name at the top of a column
2. Select the aggregation type (Count, Sum, Average, etc.)
3. Choose the field to aggregate (e.g., Amount)

**Example:** Show total deal value per stage by aggregating Amount with Sum.

### Use Compact View (Optional)
For a high-level overview with minimal card content:
1. Click **Options**
2. Turn on the toggle for **Compact view**

## Step 4: Create Personal and Team Views

### "My Pipeline"
- **Filter**: Owner = Me
- **Visibility**: Unlisted (personal view)

### "Team Pipeline"
- **Filter**: None (show all)
- **Visibility**: Workspace (shared view)

### "Closing This Month"
- **Type**: Table
- **Filter**: Close Date = This month, Stage ≠ Closed Won, Stage ≠ Closed Lost
- **Sort**: Close Date ascending

## Working with Opportunities

### Creating Opportunities
- Click **+ New** in the Opportunities view
- Or click **+** in a specific stage column

### Moving Through Stages
Drag and drop opportunity cards between columns to update their stage.

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Hygiene
- Update deals daily as they progress
- Move or close stale deals promptly
- Keep close dates realistic

### Stage Discipline
- Define clear criteria for each stage
- Move deals promptly when criteria are met
- Don't let deals sit in stages too long
