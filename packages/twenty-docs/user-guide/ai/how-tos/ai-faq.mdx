  <Accordion title="What AI capabilities are planned?">
    We're building two main AI capabilities:

    1. **AI Chatbot**: A context-aware assistant that can access your Twenty data and help you with queries
    2. **AI Agents in Workflows**: Intelligent automation that can process data, make decisions, and execute tasks within your workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will AI agents have access to all my data?">
    AI agents will operate under the permission system. You can assign specific roles to AI agents under **Settings → Roles**, giving you full control over what data they can access and what actions they can perform.

  <Accordion title="How will AI credits work?">
    AI actions will consume workflow credits based on the complexity of the task and the AI model used. More details will be available when the features launch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own AI models?">
    Initially, Twenty will use built-in AI models. Support for custom or external AI models may be added in future releases based on user feedback.
