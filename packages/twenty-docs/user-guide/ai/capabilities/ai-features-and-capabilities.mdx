## AI Chatbot

An intelligent assistant that helps you interact with your CRM data using natural language.

### Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Natural language queries** | Ask questions in plain English instead of building filters |
| **Full data access** | Query records, relationships, and metrics across your workspace |
| **Page context** | Reference "this company" or "this opportunity" based on your current view |
| **Conversational** | Follow-up questions maintain context from previous queries |

### Example Interactions

**Finding records:**
- "Show me all opportunities over $50,000"
- "Find contacts I haven't emailed in 2 weeks"
- "List companies in the healthcare industry"

**Getting insights:**
- "What's my total pipeline value?"
- "How many deals closed last month?"
- "Which stage has the most stuck opportunities?"

**Using page context:**
- "Summarize my interactions with this person" (on a contact page)
- "What opportunities are linked to this company?" (on a company page)
- "When was this deal last updated?" (on an opportunity page)

## AI Agents in Workflows

Integrate AI capabilities directly into your automation workflows.

### Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AI actions** | Add AI-powered steps to any workflow |
| **Data enrichment** | Automatically enhance records with external data |
| **Classification** | Categorize records based on content analysis |
| **Summarization** | Generate summaries from text fields |
| **Custom prompts** | Define exactly how AI processes your data |

### Use Cases

- **Lead scoring**: Automatically score and prioritize inbound leads
- **Data cleanup**: Standardize company names and contact information
- **Email drafts**: Generate follow-up emails based on meeting notes
- **Record routing**: Assign records to the right team member based on content

## Permissions and Access Control

AI agents respect your existing permission structure. This is particularly important for teams who want to control exactly what automated AI processes can access or modify in their workspace.

### Assign a Role to an AI Agent

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Click on the role you want to assign
3. Open the **Assignment** tab
4. Under **AI Agents**, click **+ Assign to AI agent**
5. Select the AI agent from the list
6. Confirm the assignment

### Why Assign Roles to AI Agents?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Security** | Limit what data AI agents can access or modify |
| **Compliance** | Ensure AI only processes the data it needs |
| **Control** | Prevent unintended actions from AI automations |
| **Auditability** | Track which actions were performed by which agent |

<Note>
For AI agents running within workflows, role assignment ensures the agent cannot access or modify data outside its intended scope—even if the workflow has broader permissions.
