## About Fields

Fields are like columns in a spreadsheet. They store different types of data like text, numbers, or dates. Fields can be standard (built-in) or custom (the ones you create).

### Standard Fields

Standard fields come built-in with Twenty to handle common business needs.

For example, `First Name` and `Last Name` are standard fields in the `People` object. They store text data for individual names.

You cannot delete standard fields, but you can deactivate them if you don't need them.

You can also customize the options of the standard ```SELECT``` type fields, for example the options for the ```Stage``` on Opportunities.

### Custom Fields

Custom fields can be added to any object. You can store text, numbers, dates, dropdown selections, and more. Use custom fields to track information that's specific to your business.

For instance, a custom field for SpaceX could be `Rocket Active Status`, indicating if a rocket is operational.

## Create a Custom Field

To add a custom field to any object, follow these steps:
	1.	Go to `Settings` in the left sidebar.
	2.	Go to `Data Model`, then select the object you wish to customize.
	3.	Proceed by clicking on `Add Field`.
	4.	Choose a field name and type that suits your requirements. Consider adding a field description for better understanding.

Your newly created field is now available within the application's fields. To display it on a specific view, click on the options menu, then select `Fields`.
