## What is Twenty's AI Assistant?

Twenty's AI assistant is an intelligent chatbot built directly into your CRM that can help you with various tasks, answer questions about your data, and provide insights about your business processes.

## Core Capabilities

### Data Analysis and Insights
The AI assistant can analyze your CRM data to provide valuable insights:

**Customer Analysis**: Get summaries of customer interactions, identify patterns in communication, and understand relationship health.

**Sales Insights**: Analyze opportunity pipelines, identify bottlenecks, and get recommendations for improving conversion rates.

**Activity Summaries**: Review recent activities, upcoming tasks, and important deadlines across your workspace.

**Performance Metrics**: Get quick answers about team performance, deal values, and activity levels.

### Question Answering
Ask the AI assistant questions about your CRM data and processes:

**Record Information**: "What's the status of the Acme Corp deal?" or "When did I last contact John Smith?"

**Process Guidance**: "How do I create a custom field?" or "What's the best way to set up email sync?"

**Data Queries**: "Show me all opportunities over $50,000" or "Which companies haven't been contacted in 30 days?"

**System Help**: Get explanations of features, settings, and best practices.

### Task Assistance
The AI can help you accomplish common CRM tasks:

**Record Creation**: Guide you through creating contacts, companies, or opportunities with the right information.
