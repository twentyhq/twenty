## What is the Command Palette?

The command palette is Twenty's power user feature that gives you instant access to any function, record, or setting through a single keyboard shortcut. Think of it as a universal search and action center.

## Opening the Command Palette

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Mac**: `Cmd + K`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + K`
- **Alternative**: Click the search icon in the top bar

The command palette opens as an overlay on your current screen, allowing you to quickly perform actions without losing your place.

## What You Can Do

### Navigate to Any Object
Type the name of any object to jump directly to it:
- "People" → Opens the People object
- "Companies" → Opens the Companies object
- "Opportunities" → Opens the Opportunities object
- "Tasks" → Opens your task list

### Access Specific Views
Navigate to specific views within objects:
- "All People" → Opens the default People view
- "My Opportunities" → Shows opportunities assigned to you
- "Open Tasks" → Displays incomplete tasks
- "Recent Companies" → Shows recently modified companies

### Find Specific Records
Search for individual records across all objects:
- Type a person's name to find their record
- Enter a company name to locate that organization
- Search for opportunity names or deal amounts
- Find tasks by title or assignee

### Perform Quick Actions
Execute common actions without navigating through menus:
- "Create Person" → Opens new person form

## Advanced Features

## Search Patterns

### Fuzzy Search
The command palette uses intelligent search that finds matches even with partial or misspelled text:
- "ppl" matches "People"
- "comp" matches "Companies"
- "opps" matches "Opportunities"
- "john sm" matches "John Smith"

### Search by Type
Use prefixes to narrow your search:
- "@" for people: "@john" finds John Smith
- "#" for companies: "#acme" finds Acme Corp
- "$" for opportunities: "$enterprise" finds Enterprise Deal
- "!" for tasks: "!follow up" finds follow-up tasks

### Recent Items
The command palette remembers your recent actions:
- Recently accessed records appear at the top
- Recent searches are saved for quick access
- Frequently used commands get priority in results

## Contextual Intelligence

**In Settings**:
