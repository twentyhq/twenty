Data import issues can be frustrating, but most problems have straightforward solutions. This guide helps you identify and resolve the most common import challenges.

## Before You Start Troubleshooting

### Check the Basics
- Ensure your file is in CSV format
- Verify the file size is under 10,000 records
- Confirm you have permission to import data
- Make sure the target object exists and is active

### Download a Sample File
Always start by downloading Twenty's sample file for your object. This shows you the exact format Twenty expects and can prevent many common issues.

## Common Error Messages

### "Email already exists"
**Problem**: You're trying to import a person with an email address that's already in your workspace.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check for existing records**: Search your People object for the email address
2. **Review deleted records**: The email might exist in a soft-deleted record
3. **Clean your import file**: Remove duplicate emails before importing
4. **Use update mode**: If you want to update existing records, ensure you include the record ID

### "Domain already exists"
**Problem**: You're importing a company with a domain that already exists in your workspace.

**Solutions**:
1. **Search existing companies**: Look for the domain in your Companies object
2. **Check domain format**: Ensure domains follow the format `https://domain.com`
3. **Remove duplicates**: Clean your CSV file to remove duplicate domains
4. **Link people to existing companies**: Instead of creating new companies, link people to existing ones

### "Required field missing"
**Problem**: A required field doesn't have a value for some records.

**Solutions**:
1. **Identify required fields**: Check which fields are marked as required in your data model
2. **Fill missing values**: Add values for all required fields in your CSV
3. **Use placeholder values**: If you don't have the data, use temporary placeholder values
4. **Make fields optional**: If appropriate, change the field requirement in your data model

### "Invalid field format"
**Problem**: Data in your CSV doesn't match the expected field format.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check date formats**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
2. **Verify email formats**: Ensure emails follow standard format (user@domain.com)
3. **Format phone numbers**: Use international format (+1234567890)
4. **Review number fields**: Remove currency symbols and use plain numbers

## Field Mapping Issues

### Fields Not Appearing in Mapping
**Problem**: Expected fields don't show up in the field mapping interface.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check field names**: Ensure your CSV headers match field names exactly
2. **Review field status**: Verify fields are active in your data model
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure you have access to edit the fields
4. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes a browser refresh resolves display issues

### Incorrect Field Types
**Problem**: Twenty maps your data to the wrong field type.

**Solutions**:
1. **Use descriptive headers**: Make your CSV headers clear and specific
2. **Manual mapping**: Override automatic mapping by selecting the correct field
3. **Pre-format data**: Format your data to match the expected field type
4. **Create custom fields**: If needed, create new fields with the right type

### Relationship Fields Not Working
**Problem**: You can't map relationship fields properly.

**Solutions**:
1. **Use unique identifiers**: Reference related records by email (People) or domain (Companies)
2. **Import in order**: Import Companies first, then People, then Opportunities
3. **Check existing records**: Ensure the records you're linking to actually exist
4. **Use correct format**: Follow the relationship field format shown in sample files

## Data Format Problems

### Date and Time Issues
**Common problems**:
- Dates in wrong format (MM/DD/YYYY instead of YYYY-MM-DD)
- Time zones not specified
- Invalid dates (like February 30th)

**Solutions**:
1. **Standardize date format**: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD
2. **Handle time zones**: Specify time zones or use UTC
3. **Validate dates**: Check for impossible dates before importing
4. **Use Excel carefully**: Excel sometimes auto-formats dates incorrectly

### Text Encoding Issues
**Common problems**:
- Special characters appearing as question marks
- Accented characters not displaying correctly
- Emoji or symbols causing errors

**Solutions**:
1. **Use UTF-8 encoding**: Save your CSV with UTF-8 encoding
2. **Test special characters**: Import a small sample with special characters first
3. **Clean problematic characters**: Remove or replace characters that cause issues
4. **Check source system**: Ensure your source system exports clean text

### Number and Currency Problems
**Common problems**:
- Currency symbols in number fields
- Thousands separators (commas) in numbers
- Decimal places formatted incorrectly

**Solutions**:
1. **Remove currency symbols**: Use plain numbers (1000 instead of $1,000)
2. **Remove separators**: Use 1000 instead of 1,000
3. **Standardize decimals**: Use periods for decimal points (1000.50)
4. **Check negative numbers**: Use minus sign (-1000) for negative values

## Duplicate Handling

### Understanding Twenty's Duplicate Rules
- **People**: Email addresses must be unique
- **Companies**: Domains must be unique
- **Custom objects**: Depends on your unique field settings

### Strategies for Handling Duplicates

**Before Import**:
1. **Clean your data**: Remove duplicates in Excel or Google Sheets
2. **Use unique identifiers**: Ensure emails and domains are unique
3. **Merge similar records**: Combine duplicate entries before importing

**During Import**:
1. **Review flagged duplicates**: Twenty will highlight potential duplicates
2. **Choose merge or skip**: Decide whether to merge with existing records or skip duplicates
3. **Update existing records**: Use record IDs to update rather than create new records

**After Import**:
1. **Review imported data**: Check for any duplicates that got through
2. **Merge manually**: Use Twenty's merge feature for any remaining duplicates
3. **Set up validation**: Create workflows to prevent future duplicates

## Import Validation Failures

### File Size and Format Issues
**Problem**: Your file is too large or in the wrong format.

**Solutions**:
1. **Split large files**: Break files over 10,000 records into smaller chunks
2. **Convert to CSV**: Ensure your file is saved as CSV, not Excel or other formats
3. **Check file encoding**: Use UTF-8 encoding for best compatibility
4. **Remove empty rows**: Clean up your CSV to remove blank rows

### Column Header Problems
**Problem**: Twenty can't read your column headers properly.

**Solutions**:
1. **Use simple headers**: Avoid special characters in column names
2. **Match field names**: Use exact field names from your data model
3. **Remove spaces**: Avoid leading or trailing spaces in headers
4. **Check for hidden characters**: Some exports include invisible characters

### Data Validation Rules
**Problem**: Your data doesn't meet Twenty's validation rules.

**Solutions**:
1. **Review field requirements**: Check what validation rules exist for each field
2. **Clean invalid data**: Fix or remove data that doesn't meet requirements
3. **Adjust validation rules**: If appropriate, modify validation rules in your data model
4. **Use placeholder data**: Temporarily use valid placeholder data for testing

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Browser and Network Issues
**Problem**: Import fails due to browser or connection problems.

**Solutions**:
1. **Try a different browser**: Chrome and Firefox usually work best
2. **Check internet connection**: Ensure you have a stable connection
3. **Disable browser extensions**: Ad blockers can sometimes interfere
4. **Clear browser cache**: Remove cached data that might cause conflicts

### Large Dataset Strategies
**Problem**: Importing very large amounts of data.

**Solutions**:
1. **Import in batches**: Break large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks
2. **Import during off-peak hours**: Reduce server load by importing when fewer people are online
3. **Test with small samples**: Always test your import process with a small file first
4. **Monitor progress**: Keep track of which batches have been successfully imported

### Complex Relationship Imports
**Problem**: Importing data with complex relationships between objects.

**Solutions**:
1. **Plan import order**: Import parent objects before child objects
2. **Use staging approach**: Import basic data first, then add relationships
3. **Create mapping documents**: Keep track of how records relate to each other
4. **Test relationships**: Verify that relationships are working correctly after import

## Prevention Strategies

### Pre-Import Checklist
- [ ] Download and review sample file
- [ ] Clean and validate your data
- [ ] Test with a small sample (10-50 records)
- [ ] Verify field mappings are correct
- [ ] Check for duplicates and required fields
- [ ] Ensure proper file format and encoding

### Data Quality Best Practices
1. **Standardize formats**: Use consistent formats for dates, phones, and addresses
2. **Validate before export**: Check data quality in your source system
3. **Document your process**: Keep notes on successful import procedures
4. **Regular backups**: Always backup your data before major imports
