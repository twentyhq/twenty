Every business works differently. That's why Twenty lets you shape the CRM around your needs, not force your processes into ours.
**Start with these three steps to set it up your way.**

**Quick Win**: Start with connecting your mailbox and customizing your data model with a few key fields. This gives you immediate value and helps your team see Twenty in action with real data. You can do so under Settings → Accounts.

## 1. Customize your data model
Twenty offers the flexibility you need to shape the data model that will best support your day-to-day.
Create objects and fields of any type, including relations between your different objects. You can do so under Settings → Data Model.
Here are a few tips:
- **You are not limited in the number of custom fields nor custom objects**. Adding custom objects and fields will not lead to upgrading your plan.
- **People, Companies and Opportunities are the three objects from where you can access the emails and meetings synchronized from your mailbox/calendar**. We recommend using those as much as possible, adding fields to categorize your records if need be. Here is an example:
  - It is best to use the People object for your prospects and partners, creating a field on the People object named ```Person Type```, instead of creating a Partner custom object. Because you would not be able to access the emails exchanged with this person from the Partner records.
  - Create different views under People, one to display partners and one to display prospects.
- Two People cannot have the same email address. Two Companies cannot have the same domain.
- You can deactivate standard fields and objects you do not want to use.
- You can hide fields from views: don't be afraid of creating fields, you won't have to display all of them.

## 2. Bring your data in
Bringing your existing data into Twenty gives your team context from the start.

### Connect your mailbox
If you have not done so when creating your workspace, connect your **Google or Microsoft account** under Settings → Accounts. This allows Twenty to:
- Import your messages and meetings
- Auto-create contacts based on interactions (optional)
- Keep communication history visible for your team

**Using another provider?**
You can add another mailbox via SMTP or another calendar via CalDAV. You will need to activate the feature under Settings → Releases → Lab, and then go back to the Settings → Accounts tab.

### Import data via csv
Use the Command menu (```Cmd + K``` or ```Ctrl + K```) to import People, Companies, Opportunities, or any custom objects via CSV.

**Key guidelines**:
- Download the sample file to understand the expected format
- Limit each file to 10k records
- Remove duplicate emails for People or duplicate domains for Companies
- Review and fix errors (highlighted in yellow) before importing

## 3. Create your first view
Creating different views is key to make the data actionable for your team.
Here is how to proceed:
-  **Add or hide columns**
    Manage the fields visible in a given view clicking on Options → Fields (from the top right). You can show/hide fields from there.

- **Reorder fields**
    Reorder the fields from a given view clicking on Options → Fields (from the top right). Drag and drop the fields to reorder them.

- **Filter your view**
    Narrow down the records displayed using the Filters from the top right.

- **Sort records**
    Reorder records displayed using the Sort function from the top right, or by clicking directly on the column name.

-  **Choose the layout**
    You can switch to a **Kanban layout** or a list **Group By** layout, as long as the object has a `Stage` or similar select-type field.

- **Save your view as Favorites**
    This can be done using the dropdown menu showing the different views.
