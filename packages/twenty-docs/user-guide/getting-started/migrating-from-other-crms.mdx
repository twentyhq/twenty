## Before You Start

### 1. Audit Your Current Data
- **Select the few objects and fields to migrate**: this migration is the opportunity for a fresh start
- **Export this data** from your current CRM
- **Remove duplicates** and outdated records
- **List active workflows** and automations

### 2. Create Your New Data Model
Follow our [data model guide](/user-guide/data-model/customize-your-data-model) to:
- **Design the data model** you need
- **Map existing fields** to Twenty's standard objects / fields
- **Identify the custom objects / fields** that you will need
- **Create them** under Settings → Data model

## Migration Process

### 1. Import Your Data
**Recommended order:**
1. **Companies** first (as base records)
2. **People** second (linked to companies)
3. **Opportunities** third (linked to people/companies)

Use the CSV import via the Command Menu  `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows). See our [data import guide](/user-guide/getting-started/import-export-data) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Recreate Workflows
- **Start simple** - recreate your most critical automations first
- **Use Twenty's workflow builder** to replace existing automations

## Common Challenges

### Data Formatting Issues
- **Email addresses** - remove duplicates (People object requirement)
- **Domain** - remove duplicates (Companies object requirement)
<Warning>
Please note that domain URLs created by the synchronization with your mailbox and calendar have the following format ```https://domain.com```
</Warning>

- **Date formats** - ensure consistent formatting (YYYY-MM-DD) or edit this format under Settings → Experience
- **Phone numbers** - use international format (+1234567890) 

### Relationship Mapping
To import relations between records using the csv import function, you can use the following fields
- **Use Twenty IDs** for complex relationships
- **Use email addresses** to link People records
- **Use domain names** to link Company records
- **Use any other field you set as unique**, which can be done in the Data Model section.  
Read our [import-export data guide](/user-guide/getting-started/import-export-data) for detailed instructions on creating relationships during CSV import.
