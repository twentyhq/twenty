:::info
`npm` does not support local packages well, opt for `yarn` instead.
:::

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Linux and MacOS" default>

Before you can install and use Twenty, make sure you install the following on your computer:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
- [yarn v4](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)

:::info Note
Yarn is now shipped with Node.js nowadays, so you don't need to install it separately.
You should only have to run `corepack enable` to enable Yarn if you haven't done it yet.
:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wsl" label="Windows (WSL)" >

1. Install WSL
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```
You should now see a prompt to restart your computer. If not, restart it manually.

Upon restart, a powershell window will open and install Ubuntu. This may take up some time.
You'll see a prompt to create a username and password for your Ubuntu installation.

2. Install and configure git

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```

3. Install Node.js, nvm, yarn
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
corepack enable
```
Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm. 

:::caution Note

Avoid using Docker on WSL as it adds an extra layer of complexity.

## Step 1: Git Clone

In your terminal, run the following command. 

:::info Note

It's better to use SSH for this step. If you already haven't set up SSH keys, please do so first. You can learn more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh). 

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH (Recommended)" default>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="https" label="HTTPS" >

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Place yourself at the root of the project

```bash
cd twenty
```

All commands in the following steps should be run from the root of the project.


## Step 3: Set up PostgreSQL Database
To install PostgreSQL with a `default` and a `test` database, and provision these databases with a user `twenty` (password: `twenty`), follow the steps below:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
<b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally:
```bash
make postgres-on-linux
```

<b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
```bash
make postgres-on-docker
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac-os" label="Mac OS" default>

<b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally:
```bash
make postgres-on-macos-intel #for intel architecture
make postgres-on-macos-arm #for M1/M2/M3 architecture
```

<b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
```bash
make postgres-on-docker
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wsl" label="Windows (WSL)">

It's better to provision your database locally:
```bash
make postgres-on-linux
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 4: Setup environment variables

Twenty requires you to set some environment variables. Locally, you should set them through a `.env` file.

To do so, make copies of the `.env.example` files in `/front` and `/server`:
```bash
cp ./packages/twenty-front/.env.example ./packages/twenty-front/.env
cp ./packages/twenty-server/.env.example ./packages/twenty-server/.env
```

## Step 5: Installing dependencies

:::info

Use `nvm` to install the correct `node` version. The `.nvmrc` ensures all contributors use the same version.

:::

To build Twenty server and seed some data into your database, run the following commands:
```bash
nvm install #recommended
nvm use #recommended

yarn
```

## Step 6: Running the project

Setup your database with the following command:
```bash
yarn nx database:reset twenty-server
```

Start the server and the frontend:
```bash
yarn nx start twenty-server
yarn nx start twenty-front
```

Twenty's server will be up and running at [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql).
Twenty's frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). Just login using the seeded demo account: `tim@apple.dev` (password: `Applecar2025`) to start using Twenty.
