Twenty aims for developer-friendliness, and your local installation should be up and running in just a bit.

<DocCardList/>

## Discord

If you have any questions or need help, you can join Twenty's [Discord](https://twenty.com/discord) server.

## MacOS and Linux users

It's better to use [yarn installation](/contributor/local-setup/yarn-setup) as this is the easiest way to get started.
But there's also an easy way to run the project with [Docker](/contributor/local-setup/docker-setup) that you can use if you are familiar with containerized environments.

## Windows users

Windows users can install the project through WSL2. [This guide](/contributor/local-setup/yarn-setup) can help you get started.

## Project structure

The repository has the following structure:
```
twenty
└───packages // contains this documentation
└───twenty-front // contains the frontend code for the application
└───twenty-server // contains the backend code for the application
└───twenty-docker // contains docker configurations for development and production build
└───many other packages you are invited to discover such as twenty-docs, twenty-ui, eslint-rules, twenty-zapier...
```

## IDE Setup

Once Twenty is running on your computer, you will get the best experience by using an IDE that supports TypeScript and ESLint.
You will find a guide for [VSCode](/contributor/local-setup/ide-setup) further in the documentation.
