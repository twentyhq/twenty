## Übersicht

Import not working? This guide helps you identify and fix common import errors step by step.

## How Import Validation Works

After uploading your file and mapping columns, Twenty validates your data:

1. **Validation runs** — Twenty checks each row for errors
2. **Errors are highlighted** — problematic rows appear in **yellow**
3. **You can fix in-place** — edit cells directly in the import UI
4. **Or remove rows** — skip problematic records entirely

<Note>**Fix errors in the UI.** You don't need to go back to your spreadsheet. Edit cells directly during import to save time.</Note>

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Identify the Error Type

Click on a highlighted row to see the specific error message. Common error types:

| Fehlermeldung                                                         | What It Means                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Duplicate values highlighted in yellow                                | Value already exists in Twenty or appears twice in your file |
| `{field} is not a valid {type}` (hover on yellow cell)                | Data doesn't match expected format                           |
| Required field highlighted                                            | A required field is empty                                    |
| `Can't connect to {object}. No unique record found...` (import fails) | Referenced record doesn't exist                              |
| `Too many records. Up to 10000 allowed` (upload blocked)              | File has more than 10,000 records                            |

### Step 2: Fix the Error

Follow the specific instructions below for each error type.

## Error: Duplicate Value

### Was Sie sehen werden

Rows with duplicate values are **highlighted in yellow** in the import UI before the import starts.

### What It Means

A unique field (email, domain) either:

* Already exists in Twenty
* Appears twice in your file

### How to Fix

**Option 1: Edit the duplicate value**

1. Click the cell with the error
2. Change to a unique value
3. Continue with import

**Option 2: Remove the duplicate row**

1. Click the X next to the row
2. The row will be skipped during import

**Option 3: Let Twenty update the existing record**

1. Ensure your file includes a unique identifier (`email`, `domain`, or `id`)
2. Map the unique identifier field
3. Twenty will update the existing record instead of creating a duplicate

<Note>
  **You can update unique fields too.**

  * If you keep the `id` but change the `email` → the email will be updated
  * If you keep the `email` but change the `id` → the id will be updated

  As long as one unique identifier matches, Twenty updates the record.
</Note>

### How to Prevent This Error

Before importing:

1. Sort your spreadsheet by the unique field
2. Remove duplicate rows
3. Check if records already exist in Twenty

<Warning>
  **Soft-deleted records count toward uniqueness.**

  Check Command Menu → See deleted records. Records there still enforce uniqueness. Permanently delete them or restore and update.
</Warning>

## Error: Invalid Format

### Was Sie sehen werden

The cell value is highlighted in yellow. Hover over it to see the error message:

```
{field name} is not a valid {field type}
```

### What It Means

The data doesn't match the expected format for that field type.

### How to Fix — By Field Type

#### E-Mail

**Problem:** Invalid email format
**Solution:** Use format `name@domain.com`

```
❌ john.smith@
❌ john smith@acme.com
✓ john.smith@acme.com
```

#### Domäne

**Problem:** Inconsistent format may cause duplicates
**Solution:** Use `https://domain.com` format (recommended)

```
⚠️ acme.com         (valid, but not recommended)
⚠️ www.acme.com     (valid, but not recommended)
✅ https://acme.com  (recommended)
```

<Note>All formats are valid, but `https://domain.com` is recommended because it matches the format used by email/calendar sync. Using other formats may create duplicate companies.</Note>

#### Datum

**Problem:** Unrecognized date format
**Solution:** Use consistent format throughout file

```
✓ 2024-03-15        (YYYY-MM-DD - recommended)
✓ 03/15/2024        (MM/DD/YYYY)
✓ 15/03/2024        (DD/MM/YYYY)
```

#### Telefon

**Problem:** Missing required columns
**Solution:** Include all phone columns

| Column                                  | Beispiel     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Phones / Primary Phone Number**       | `4159095555` |
| **Phones / Primary Phone Country Code** | `US`         |
| **Phones / Primary Phone Calling Code** | `+1`         |

#### Boolesch

**Problem:** Wrong boolean value
**Solution:** Use uppercase `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```
❌ true
❌ yes
❌ 1
✓ TRUE
✓ FALSE
```

#### Select / Multi-Select

**Problem:** Value doesn't match existing options
**Solution:** Use **API names**, not display labels

How to find API names:

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the object and field
3. Enable **Advanced mode** (toggle at bottom right)
4. Use the API name (e.g., `OPTION_1`, not "Option 1")

```
❌ High Priority
✓ HIGH_PRIORITY
```

#### Währung

**Problem:** Missing amount or currency code
**Solution:** Fill both columns

| Column                | Beispiel  |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| **Amount / Amount**   | `1234.56` |
| **Amount / Currency** | `USD`     |

#### Nummer

**Problem:** Non-numeric characters
**Solution:** Numbers only, period for decimals

```
❌ $1,234.56
❌ 1,234.56
✓ 1234.56
```

## Error: Required Field Missing

### Was Sie sehen werden

The row is highlighted in yellow with the required field cell marked.

### What It Means

A required field is empty for this row.

### How to Fix

**Option 1: Enter a value**

1. Click the empty cell
2. Enter a value
3. Continue with import

**Option 2: Remove the row**

1. If you don't have the data, click X to skip the row

### How to Prevent This Error

Before importing, identify required fields:

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select your object
3. Check which fields are marked as required

---

## Error: Relation Not Found

### Was Sie sehen werden

This error appears **after the import starts** — the import fails with a message like:

```
Can't connect to company. No unique record found with condition: id = 7776ee49-f608-4a77-8cc8-6fe96ae1e43f
```

This means there is no Company in Twenty with that specific identifier.

<Note>Unlike other errors, this one is not caught during the data review step. The import will start and then fail when it encounters the missing relation.</Note>

### What It Means

You're trying to link to a record that doesn't exist in Twenty.

### How to Fix

**Option 1: Import parent records first**

1. Cancel the current import
2. Import the parent records (e.g., Companies)
3. Then import the child records (e.g., People)

**Option 2: Fix the reference value**

1. Check the reference value in your file
2. Ensure it exactly matches an existing record
3. Verify format: domains should be `https://domain.com`

**Option 3: Remove the relation**

1. Clear the cell to import without the relation
2. Add the relation manually later

### How to Prevent This Error

1. **Import in the correct order:**
   * Companies first
   * People second (with company references)
   * Opportunities third

2. **Verify reference values:**
   * Export parent records to get exact identifiers
   * Use domain format `https://domain.com`
   * Check for typos and case sensitivity

<Warning>
  **Import will fail if a reference is made to a non-existent record.**

  Always import parent objects before child objects.
</Warning>

## Error: File Too Large

### Was Sie sehen werden

This error appears **when uploading your file** — the upload is blocked entirely:

```
Too many records. Up to 10000 allowed
```

You won't be able to proceed to the data review step until you reduce the file size.

### What It Means

Your file has more than 10,000 records.

### How to Fix

**Option 1: Split into multiple files**

1. Divide your data into files of 10,000 records or fewer
2. Import each file separately
3. Maintain import order (Companies before People)

**Option 2: Use API import**
For very large datasets, use the API which has no record limit.
See: [How to Import Data via API](/l/de/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-data-via-api)

## Error: Field Not Recognized

### What It Means

A column in your file can't be mapped because the field doesn't exist in Twenty.

### How to Fix

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the object you're importing
3. Click **+ Add field**
4. Create the custom field with the appropriate type
5. Re-upload your file

<Note>The CSV import creates records, not fields. All fields must exist before importing.</Note>

---

## Error: User Relation Empty

### What It Means

You're trying to assign a record to a user (Owner, Assignee) but the relation isn't being mapped.

### Common Causes

1. **User hasn't accepted their invitation** — the user doesn't exist in Twenty yet
2. **Using user ID from old system** — Twenty can't match IDs from another system
3. **Wrong email format** — the email doesn't match the user's Twenty account

### How to Fix

1. Ensure all users have **accepted their invitation** to your Twenty workspace
2. Use the user's **email address** (not their name or old system ID)
3. Use the same email they used to join Twenty

<Warning>
  **Users must accept invitations before importing.**

  If a user hasn't accepted their invitation, records referencing them will have empty user relations.
</Warning>
