title: Create a Kanban View for Projects
description: Track projects through stages using a visual board.
---

import { VimeoEmbed } from '/snippets/vimeo-embed.mdx';

Use a Kanban view to visualize your projects (or any object with stages) as cards moving through columns.

<VimeoEmbed videoId="927888627" title="Video demonstration" />

## Prerequisites

Your object needs a **Select field** to use as columns (e.g., Status, Stage, Phase).

If you don't have one:

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select your object
3. Add a Select field with your stage options

## Steps

1. Navigate to your object (e.g., Projects, Tasks)
2. Click the view dropdown → **+ Add view**
3. Name your view (e.g., "Project Board")
4. Click **Create**
5. Click **Options** and select **Kanban** as the layout
6. The view uses your Select field for columns automatically
7. انقر على **حفظ**

## Configure Your Board

### Show Key Fields on Cards

1. Click **Options → Fields**
2. Find fields in the "Hidden Fields" section
3. Click the **eye icon** to display them on cards
4. Drag to reorder

### Enable Compact View

For a high-level overview:

1. Click **Options**
2. Turn on **Compact view**

Cards show only the record name.

### Add Aggregations

Show counts or totals at the top of each column:

1. Click the number next to a column name
2. Select an aggregation (Count, Sum, etc.)
3. Choose a field if needed

## Moving Cards

Drag and drop cards between columns to update their status.

<VimeoEmbed videoId="927888627" title="Video demonstration" />

## Example: Task Board

| Column (Status) | Cards             |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| **To Do**       | New tasks         |
| **In Progress** | Active work       |
| **Review**      | Awaiting approval |
| **Done**        | Completed         |
