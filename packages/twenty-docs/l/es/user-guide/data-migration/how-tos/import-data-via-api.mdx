title: Import Data via API
description: When and how to use Twenty's APIs for large-scale data imports.
---

## Overview

Twenty provides both **GraphQL** and **REST APIs** for programmatic data import. Use the API when CSV import isn't practical for your data volume or when you need automated, recurring imports.

## When to Use API Import

| Scenario                           | Recommended Method            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Under 10,000 records               | CSV Import                    |
| 10,000 - 50,000 records            | CSV Import (split into files) |
| **50,000+ records**                | **API Import**                |
| One-time migration                 | Either (based on volume)      |
| **Recurring imports**              | **API Import**                |
| **Real-time sync**                 | **API Import**                |
| **Integration with other systems** | **API Import**                |

<Note>For datasets in the hundreds of thousands, the API is significantly faster and more reliable than multiple CSV imports.</Note>

## API Rate Limits

Twenty enforces rate limits to ensure system stability:

| Limit                      | Value                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Requests per minute**    | 100                   |
| **Records per batch call** | 60                    |
| **Maximum throughput**     | ~6,000 records/minute |

<Warning>
  **Plan your import around these limits.**

  For 100,000 records at maximum throughput, expect approximately 17 minutes of import time. Add buffer time for error handling and retries.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Go to **Settings → Developers**
2. Click **+ Create API key**
3. Give your key a descriptive name
4. Copy the API key immediately (it won't be shown again)
5. Store it securely

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secret.**

  Anyone with your API key can access and modify your workspace data. Never commit it to code repositories or share it publicly.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Choose Your API

Twenty supports two API types:

| API         | Best For                                                    | Documentation                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **GraphQL** | Flexible queries, fetching related data, complex operations | [API Docs](/l/es/developers/extend/capabilities/apis) |
| **REST**    | Simple CRUD operations, familiar REST patterns              | [API Docs](/l/es/developers/extend/capabilities/apis) |

Both APIs support:

* Creating, reading, updating, and deleting records
* **Batch operations** — create or update up to 60 records per call

**For imports, use batch operations** to maximize throughput within rate limits.

### Step 3: Plan Your Import Order

Just like CSV imports, **order matters** for relations:

1. **Companies** first (no dependencies)
2. **People** second (can link to Companies)
3. **Opportunities** third (can link to Companies and People)
4. **Tasks/Notes** (can link to any of the above)
5. **Custom objects** (following their dependencies)

## Best Practices

### Batch Your Requests

* Don't send records one at a time
* Group up to **60 records per API call**
* This maximizes throughput within rate limits

### Handle Rate Limits

* Implement delays between requests (600ms minimum for sustained imports)
* Use exponential backoff when you hit limits
* Monitor for 429 (Too Many Requests) responses

### Validate Data First

* Clean and validate your data before importing
* Check required fields are populated
* Verify formats match Twenty's requirements (see [Field Mapping](/l/es/user-guide/data-migration/capabilities/field-mapping))

### Log Everything

* Log every record imported (including IDs)
* Log errors with full context
* This helps debug issues and verify completion

### Test First

* Test with a small batch (10-20 records)
* Verify data appears correctly in Twenty
* Then run the full import

### Upsert to Avoid Duplicates

The GraphQL API supports **batch upsert** — update if the record exists, create if not. This prevents duplicates when re-running imports.

## Finding Object and Field Names

To see available objects and fields:

1. Go to **Settings → API and Webhooks**
2. Browse the **Metadata API**
3. View all standard and custom objects with their fields

The documentation shows all standard and custom objects, their fields, and the expected data types.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between GraphQL and REST?">
    GraphQL lets you request exactly the data you need in a single query and is better for complex operations. REST uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and may be more familiar if you've worked with traditional APIs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update existing records via API?">
    Yes! Use update mutations (GraphQL) or PUT/PATCH requests (REST) with the record's `id`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle duplicates?">
    Query for existing records first using unique identifiers (email, domain). Update if exists, create if not.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete records via API?">
    Yes, use delete mutations (GraphQL) or DELETE requests (REST).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a Python or Node.js SDK?">
    Not currently, but both APIs work with any HTTP client in any language.
