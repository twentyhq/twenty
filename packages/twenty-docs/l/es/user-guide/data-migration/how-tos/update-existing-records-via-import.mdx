title: Update Existing Records via Import
description: Complete step-by-step guide to bulk updating records using CSV import.
---

## Overview

Need to update many records at once? Instead of editing them one by one, use the CSV import to bulk update existing records.

**Use cases:**

* Update job titles for multiple people
* Change company information in bulk
* Add data to new custom fields
* Correct data errors across many records

## How It Works

When you import a file containing a **unique identifier** that matches an existing record, Twenty updates that record instead of creating a duplicate.

| If unique identifier...    | Twenty will...                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Matches an existing record | **Update** the existing record                   |
| Doesn't match any record   | **Create** a new record                          |
| Is missing from your file  | **Create** a new record (with auto-generated ID) |

<Warning>
  **Multi-Select fields are overwritten, not merged.**

  If a record has `Option A` and `Option B` selected, and you import `["Option C"]`, the record will only have `Option C` after import. The import replaces all previous selections—it does not add to them.

  To keep existing values, include them all in your import: `["Option A","Option B","Option C"]`
</Warning>

## Step 1: Export Your Current Data

First, export the records you want to update:

1. Navigate to the object (People, Companies, etc.)
2. **Add the columns you need** — click **Options → Fields** to show the fields you want to update
3. **Filter if needed** — narrow down to only the records you want to update
4. Click **⋮** → **Export view**
5. Save the CSV file

<Note>**Why export first?** The exported file has the correct format, includes unique identifiers, and maps automatically during import.</Note>

### What Gets Exported

* All visible columns in your current view
* The record's unique identifiers (`id`, `email`, `domain`)
* Current field values you can modify

## Step 2: Edit the CSV File

Open the exported file in your spreadsheet application (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.):

1. **Keep the unique identifier column** — don't delete `id`, `email`, or `domain`
2. **Update the values** in the columns you want to change
3. **Remove columns you don't need to update** (optional, but cleaner)
4. **Don't change unique identifier values** — or Twenty will create new records

### Example: Updating Job Titles

**Exported file:**

```csv
id,email,firstName,lastName,jobTitle
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001,john@acme.com,John,Smith,Sales Rep
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002,jane@acme.com,Jane,Doe,Sales Rep
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003,bob@acme.com,Bob,Johnson,Sales Rep
```

**After your edits:**

```csv
id,email,firstName,lastName,jobTitle
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001,john@acme.com,John,Smith,Account Executive
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002,jane@acme.com,Jane,Doe,Senior Account Executive
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003,bob@acme.com,Bob,Johnson,Account Executive
```

<Warning>
  **Don't change the unique identifier values.**

  If you change `john@acme.com` to `john.smith@acme.com`, Twenty will create a new record instead of updating the existing one.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Import the Updated File

1. Navigate to the object
2. Click **⋮** → **Import records**
3. Upload your edited CSV file
4. **Ensure the unique identifier is mapped** — verify `email`, `domain`, or `id` is mapped correctly
5. Review the field mappings
6. Check for errors
7. Click **Confirm**

Twenty matches records by the unique identifier and updates them with new values.

## Choosing the Right Unique Identifier

| Object             | Recommended      | Alternative | Notes                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| **People**         | `email`          | `id`        | Email is human-readable      |
| **Companies**      | `domain`         | `id`        | Domain is human-readable     |
| **Custom objects** | Any unique field | `id`        | Use your custom unique field |

<Note>**Use only ONE unique identifier.** Don't map both `email` AND `id`. This can cause confusion and errors.</Note>

### Using Custom Unique Fields

If you have a custom field marked as unique (like an external ID from another system):

1. Include that field in your export and import
2. Map it during import
3. Twenty will match on that field

## Step 4: Verify the Updates

After importing:

1. Open a few updated records
2. Verify the changes were applied
3. Check that no duplicate records were created

## What About Fields Not in Your File?

**Fields not included in your import file remain unchanged.**

| Your file includes...        | Result                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `email`, `jobTitle`          | Only `jobTitle` is updated; other fields stay the same |
| `email`, `jobTitle`, `phone` | `jobTitle` and `phone` are updated                     |

This means you only need to include the fields you want to change (plus the unique identifier).

## Combining Updates and New Records

You can update existing records AND create new ones in the same import:

```csv
email,firstName,lastName,jobTitle
john@acme.com,John,Smith,Senior Manager    ← Updates existing (email matches)
newperson@acme.com,New,Person,Analyst      ← Creates new (email doesn't match)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                        | Problem                                                 | Result                                 | Solution                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Changing unique identifier** | Changed `john@acme.com` to `john.smith@acme.com`        | Creates new record instead of updating | Keep unique identifiers unchanged         |
| **Multiple unique fields**     | Mapping both `email` AND `id`                           | Potential matching conflicts           | Map only ONE unique identifier            |
| **No unique identifier**       | File only has `firstName`, `lastName`, `jobTitle`       | All rows create new records            | Always include `email`, `domain`, or `id` |
| **Case mismatch**              | File has `John@acme.com` but Twenty has `john@acme.com` | Creates new record                     | Export from Twenty to get exact values    |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if some records don't exist yet?">
    Records with unique identifiers that don't match existing records will be created as new records. This lets you update and create in the same import.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I clear/empty a field value?">
    Yes, leave the cell empty in your CSV. The import will clear that field's value on the existing record.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to fields I don't include in the import?">
    Fields not in your import file remain unchanged on existing records. Only fields you include are updated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update relation fields (like Company)?">
    Yes! Include the relation's unique identifier (e.g., `companyDomain`) and map it to the relation field. The relation will be updated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know which records will be updated vs. created?">
    During the import review step, Twenty shows you how many records will be updated vs. created based on unique identifier matches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I undo a bulk update?">
    There's no automatic undo. We recommend exporting your data as a backup before making bulk updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Export first** — always start from an export to ensure correct format
2. **Backup before updating** — export your data before making bulk changes
3. **Test with a few records** — try updating 5-10 records first before doing a large batch
4. **Use human-readable identifiers** — `email` and `domain` are easier to verify than `id`
5. **Only include necessary columns** — fewer columns means less chance for errors
