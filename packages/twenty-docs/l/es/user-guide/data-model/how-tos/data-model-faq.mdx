## Object Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete a custom object?">
    Yes, custom objects can be deleted. You can also deactivate them first, which hides the object and its data from the interface while preserving the data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete standard objects (People, Companies, etc.)?">
    No, standard objects cannot be deleted. You can only deactivate them, which hides them from the interface but preserves the data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many custom objects can I create?">
    You can create as many custom objects and fields as you need — the price doesn't change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I rename a standard object?">
    You can rename the label of standard objects (People, Companies, Opportunities), but not their API names. The API names are fixed for consistency across all Twenty workspaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change an object's icon?">
    Yes, you can change the icon for both standard and custom objects in **Settings → Data Model**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reorder objects in the left navigation bar?">
    Not yet. Object ordering in the navigation is currently fixed, but this feature is planned for a future release.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I hide objects from the left navigation bar?">
    All active objects appear in the navigation. You can deactivate objects you don't need under **Settings → Data Model**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Field Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change a field type after creation?">
    No, field types cannot be changed after creation. If you need a different type, create a new field with the correct type, migrate your data, then deactivate the old field.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do I need different singular and plural names?">
    Our GraphQL API uses both forms for different operations:

    * `createPerson` (singular) for single record actions
    * `createPeople` (plural) for bulk operations

    This creates limitations when singular and plural forms are the same, but it improves the developer experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are some field names protected?">
    Certain field names like `Type` or `Application` are reserved for system use. Choose alternative names like `Category` or `Classification` instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I deactivate a field?">
    * The field is hidden from the interface
    * Existing data is preserved
    * You can still access the field via API
    * Existing relations remain but you can't create new ones
    * You can reactivate the field later
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I make a field required?">
    Currently, you cannot make custom fields required. All fields accept empty values. You can use workflows to enforce required fields by sending alerts or blocking actions when fields are empty.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between unique and required?">
    * **Unique**: No two records can have the same value in this field
    * **Required**: The field must have a value (not currently supported for custom fields)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create formula fields?">
    Formula fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. In the meantime, you can use workflows to calculate and update field values automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have nested fields in my objects?">
    Nested fields are coming in **Q1 2026**. Currently, you can use workflows to bring field values from related objects. For example, to display a company's industry on a Person record, create a custom field on People and use a workflow to synchronize the value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reorder fields in objects?">
    Field reordering will be available with custom layouts in **Q4 2025**. Currently, fields appear in alphabetical order.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Relations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I have a relation pointing to the same object?">
    Yes! Self-referencing relations are supported and recommended for use cases like account hierarchies. For example, create a relation from Companies to Companies to track parent/child accounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create many-to-many relationships?">
    Many-to-many relationships are coming in **H1 2026**. Currently, create an intermediate object with two one-to-many relationships as a workaround.

    For example, to link People and Projects (many-to-many), create a "Project Assignments" object with:

    * A relation to People (many assignments → one person)
    * A relation to Projects (many assignments → one project)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are relations to multiple object types (Morph relationships)?">
    These allow one object to relate to multiple different object types through a single field. For example, Notes can be attached to People AND Companies AND Opportunities simultaneously.

    Each Note links to one Person, one Company, and one Opportunity at the same time.

    Learn more in [Relation Fields](/l/es/user-guide/data-model/capabilities/relation-fields).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple relations between the same objects?">
    Yes, you can create multiple relations between the same two objects. For example, a Company could have both a "Primary Contact" and "Billing Contact" relation to People.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to relations when I delete a record?">
    When you delete a record, the relation link is removed from the related records. The related records themselves are not deleted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create circular relations?">
    While technically possible, circular relations (A → B → C → A) should be avoided as they can cause confusion and potential performance issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Access and Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where can I see and edit my data model?">
    Go to **Settings → Data Model** to view and edit all your objects and fields.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I see the Data Model under Settings?">
    Reach out to your workspace administrator. Data model access is usually restricted to administrators only.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many records I can have?">
    There's no hard limit on record counts. However, very large datasets may impact performance in some views. Use filters and views to manage large datasets effectively.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import data into custom objects?">
    Yes, you can import CSV data into any object, including custom objects. The import process supports field mapping for custom fields. See [How to Prepare Your CSV Files](/l/es/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/prepare-your-csv-files).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export my data model configuration?">
    Currently, there's no built-in export for data model configuration. Contact support if you need to migrate your data model between workspaces.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
