description: Handle Typeform's webhook payload to create leads from form submissions.

For standard webhook setup, see [Set Up a Webhook Trigger](/l/es/user-guide/workflows/how-tos/connect-to-other-tools/set-up-a-webhook-trigger). This article covers the specific handling required for Typeform's custom payload structure.

### Step 1: Create a Webhook Workflow

1. Go to **Settings → Workflows**
2. Click **+ New Workflow**
3. Select **Webhook** as the trigger
4. Copy the webhook URL

### Step 2: Configure Typeform

1. In Typeform, open your form
2. Go to **Connect → Webhooks**
3. Paste your Twenty webhook URL
4. Save

### Step 3: Understand the Typeform Payload

Typeform sends a nested JSON structure. Here's a simplified example:

```json
{
  "event_type": "form_response",
  "form_response": {
    "form_id": "abc123",
    "submitted_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "answers": [
      {
        "text": "Jane",
        "type": "text",
        "field": { "id": "field1", "type": "short_text", "title": "First Name" }
      },
      {
        "text": "Smith",
        "type": "text",
        "field": { "id": "field2", "type": "short_text", "title": "Last Name" }
      },
      {
        "text": "Acme Corp",
        "type": "text",
        "field": { "id": "field3", "type": "short_text", "title": "Company" }
      },
      {
        "email": "jane@acme.com",
        "type": "email",
        "field": { "id": "field4", "type": "email", "title": "Email" }
      },
      {
        "type": "choice",
        "field": { "id": "field5", "type": "dropdown", "title": "Team Size" },
        "choice": { "label": "10-50" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Key things to note:

* Form data is nested under `form_response`
* **Answers are returned as an array**, not as named fields
* Each answer includes the field type and title for reference

### Step 4: Extract Fields from the Answers Array

Since `answers` is an array, you can only select the entire array in subsequent steps — not individual fields. Add a **Code** action to extract the fields you need:

```javascript
export const main = async (params: {
  answers: any;
}): Promise<object> => {
  const { answers } = params;

  // Handle input that may come as a string or an array
  const answersFormatted = typeof answers === "string"
    ? JSON.parse(answers)
    : answers;

  // Extract fields by position or by finding the field type
  const firstName = answersFormatted[0]?.text || "";
  const lastName = answersFormatted[1]?.text || "";
  const company = answersFormatted[2]?.text || "";
  const email = answersFormatted.find(a => a.type === "email")?.email || "";
  const teamSize = answersFormatted.find(a => a.type === "choice")?.choice?.label || "";

  return {
    contact: {
      firstName,
      lastName,
      company,
      email,
      teamSize
    }
  };
};
```

Now in subsequent steps, you can select `contact.firstName`, `contact.email`, etc. from the variable picker.

### Step 5: Create the Record

Add a **Create Record** action:

| Field          | Value                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object**     | People                                               |
| **First Name** | `{{code.contact.firstName}}`                         |
| **Last Name**  | `{{code.contact.lastName}}`                          |
| **Email**      | `{{code.contact.email}}`                             |
| **Company**    | Search or create based on `{{code.contact.company}}` |

### Step 6: Test and Activate

1. Submit a test response in Typeform
2. Check the workflow run to verify data was captured
3. Activate the workflow
