## Overview

Dashboards in Twenty are organized in a hierarchy: **Dashboards → Tabs → Widgets**. Each dashboard can contain multiple tabs, and each tab contains widgets (charts, numbers, iFrames).

## Creating a Dashboard

1. Go to **Dashboards** in the navigation
2. Click **+ New Dashboard**
3. Give your dashboard a name
4. Start adding tabs and widgets

## Working with Tabs

Tabs help you organize your dashboard into logical sections.

### Creating Tabs

1. In edit mode, click **+ Add Tab**
2. Name your tab (e.g., "Pipeline Overview", "Team Performance")
3. Add widgets to the tab

### Duplicating Tabs

1. Click on the tab you want to duplicate
2. Click the **Duplicate** button in the side panel

## Dashboard Layout

### Arranging Widgets

* Drag and drop to position
* Resize for emphasis
* Group related charts together

### Duplicating a Dashboard

1. Exit edit mode (view mode only)
2. Open the command bar with **Cmd + K** (or **Ctrl + K** on Windows)
3. Select **Duplicate dashboard**

### Best Practices

* **Logical flow**: Arrange from overview to detail
* **Visual hierarchy**: Larger charts for key metrics
* **Consistent styling**: Use matching colors and fonts

## Visibility & Access

### Dashboard Visibility

Dashboards are visible to everyone who has access to your Twenty workspace. There is no private dashboard option at the moment.

### Favorites

You can add dashboards to your favorites for quick access. This is a personal setting—your favorites are not visible to other users.

To add a dashboard to favorites, open the dashboard and click the star icon.

### Timezone Behavior

Dashboards currently display data based on the timezone of the user viewing them. This means the same dashboard may show different metrics for team members in different regions (e.g., APAC vs. US).

<Note>
  **Coming soon**: We will add the ability to set a specific timezone for a dashboard, so all users see consistent data regardless of their location.

  **Coming soon**: Dashboard-level filters will allow you to apply filters across all widgets at once, making it faster to explore your data.
