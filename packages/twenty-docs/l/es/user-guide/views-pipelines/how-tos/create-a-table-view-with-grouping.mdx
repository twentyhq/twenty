## Steps

1. Navigate to the object (People, Companies, etc.)
2. Click the view dropdown → **+ Add view**
3. Name your view (e.g., "Companies by Type")
4. Click **Create**
5. Click **Options → Group**
6. Choose a Select field to group by
7. Click **Save**

## Configure Group Order

Under **Options → Group → Sort**, choose how groups are ordered:

| Option                   | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Alphabetical**         | A to Z                                        |
| **Reverse alphabetical** | Z to A                                        |
| **Manual order**         | Drag groups to reorder under "Visible groups" |

Click the **eye icon** next to a group to hide it from the view.

<Note>
  **For best performance, limit to 10-15 visible groups.** If you need more, consider using a Dashboard instead.
</Note>

## Example: Companies by Industry

1. Go to **Companies**
2. Create a new view named "By Industry"
3. Click **Options → Group**
4. Select the **Industry** field
5. Save

Now your companies are organized by industry, making it easy to focus on one segment at a time.
