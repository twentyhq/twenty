## Understanding Views

Views are saved configurations that determine how your data is displayed. Each view can have its own:

* **Layout**: Table, Kanban, or Calendar
* **Filters**: Which records to show
* **Sorting**: How records are ordered
* **Fields**: Which columns are visible

## View Types

### Table View

The default spreadsheet-like view showing records in rows with customizable columns.

### Kanban View

A visual board view where records appear as cards organized by stages. Ideal for:

* Sales pipelines
* Project tracking
* Any workflow with defined stages

### Calendar View

Display records with date fields on a calendar. Perfect for:

* Meetings and events
* Deadlines and due dates
* Time-based planning
