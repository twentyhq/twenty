title: Can I Track Email Activity on All Objects?
description: Understanding email activity tracking across different objects.

## Supported Objects

Email activity is currently available on **three standard objects**:

| Object            | What You See                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **People**        | All emails exchanged with that specific contact                  |
| **Companies**     | All emails with anyone from that company (based on email domain) |
| **Opportunities** | Emails related to the company linked to the opportunity          |

## Why Only These Objects?

People, Companies, and Opportunities are the core relationship objects where email context adds the most value. Email threads are automatically linked based on:

* **Email address** → matched to People records
* **Email domain** → matched to Company records
* **Company relation** → linked to Opportunities

## Custom Objects

**Email tracking is not available on custom objects** at this time.

If you need email context on a custom object, consider:

* Using a relation field to link your custom object to People or Companies
* Viewing email history on the linked People/Company record

## Future Plans

Extending email visibility to custom objects is being considered. Share your use case on our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/discussions) to help prioritize this feature.
