**Note**: To connect your calendar and configure sync settings, visit [Email & Calendar Setup](/l/es/user-guide/calendar-emails/overview).

## How Calendar Integration Works

Twenty automatically syncs your calendar events and links them to the relevant CRM records, giving you a complete view of your meeting history with contacts and companies.

## Calendar Tab

Next to the Emails tab on records, you'll find a `Calendar` tab that contains the history of meetings scheduled with the record.

### Available For

* **People**: View all meetings scheduled with a specific contact
* **Companies**: See all meetings related to a company and its employees
* **Opportunities**: Access meeting history related to the company linked to this opportunity

### Viewing Meeting History

1. **Navigate to a Record**: Go to any Person, Company, or Opportunity record
2. **Select the Calendar Tab**: Click on the `Calendar` tab next to the Emails tab
3. **Browse Meeting History**: View all scheduled meetings and their details
4. **Access Meeting Context**: See meeting participants, times, and related information

## Visibility Settings

Calendar data follows the same visibility settings as emails, ensuring consistent privacy controls across both communication channels.

## What Gets Synced

* **External Meetings**: All meetings with contacts outside your organization
* **Automatic Linking**: Meetings connect to existing People and Company records based on attendee email addresses
* **Meeting Details**: Subject, time, duration, and participants
* **Updates**: New calendar events sync automatically

## What Doesn't Get Synced

* **Internal Meetings**: Meetings with only colleagues (same domain) remain private
* **Private Events**: Events marked as private in your calendar
