## How Email Integration Works

Twenty automatically links emails from your connected mailboxes to the relevant CRM records, keeping all communication history in one place.

### Objects Where Emails Can Be Found

Email conversations appear in three main objects:

* **People**: View all emails exchanged with a specific contact
* **Companies**: See all emails related to a company and its employees
* **Opportunities**: Access email threads related to the company linked to this opportunity. Email threads from individual people on the opportunity are not shown yet.

### Viewing Email Threads

1. **Navigate to a Record**: Go to any Person, Company, or Opportunity record
2. **Select the Emails Tab**: Click on the `Emails` tab to view synced emails
3. **Open an Email Thread**: Click on any email to open and read the full conversation
4. **Browse History**: Scroll through the complete email history with that contact

## What You'll See

### Email Thread View

When you open an email thread, you can:

* **Read Full Conversations**: See the complete email exchange
* **View Participants**: See all people involved in the email thread
* **Check Timestamps**: Know exactly when each email was sent
* **Access Context**: Understand the full communication history

### Email Visibility

Depending on your mailbox settings, you might see:

* **Full Content**: Complete email text and details
* **Subject + Metadata**: Subject line, sender, recipient, and timestamp
* **Metadata Only**: Basic information without email content

## Email Sync Behavior

### What Gets Synced

* **External Emails**: All emails with contacts outside your organization
* **Automatic Linking**: Emails connect to existing People and Company records
* **Multiple Addresses**: Emails from any address link to the same contact record
* **Updates**: New emails appear within 5 minutes

### What Doesn't Get Synced

* **Internal Emails**: Emails between colleagues (same domain) remain private
* **Group Emails**: Distribution lists and group emails are excluded
* **Excluded Folders**: Folders you've chosen not to sync (configured under Settings → Accounts → Email)

### Selective Folder Sync (Lab Feature)

Control which email folders sync with Twenty:

1. Enable `Message Folder` in Settings → Releases → Lab
2. Configure folders under Settings → Accounts → Email
3. Choose specific folders to include or exclude (Inbox, Sent, Archive, custom folders)

## Troubleshooting Email Sync

### Common Sync Issues

* **Sync Delays**: Emails appear within 5 minutes, but initial imports take longer
* **Missing Emails**: Check if:
  * Folders are excluded in Message Folder settings
  * Contact auto-creation is disabled (emails need existing Twenty records)
  * Email is from colleagues (same domain) or group lists
  * Mailbox is still completing initial sync

### Email Limitations

* **System Folders**: Some email folders may not be available for sync
* **Aliases**: Only true mailboxes can be connected (not email aliases)
