## Overview

Twenty is designed to be extensible. Use our APIs, webhooks, and app framework to integrate with your existing tools and build custom functionality.

## What You Can Do

* **APIs**: Query and modify your CRM data programmatically using REST or GraphQL
* **Webhooks**: Receive real-time notifications when events occur in Twenty
* **Apps**: Build custom applications that extend Twenty's capabilities - Coming soon!
