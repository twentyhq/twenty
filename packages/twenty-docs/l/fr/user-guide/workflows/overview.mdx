## Why Workflows Matter

Twenty was built to bring maximum flexibility to its users. Rather than forcing you to adapt your business processes to rigid, pre-built features, workflows enable you to build automations that create the CRM that best supports your unique business use cases.

Workflows are Twenty's in-app feature for building these automations. They give you the building blocks to create exactly what your business needs, when it needs it.

## What can I do with workflows?

We recommend building automations for two main purposes:

1. **Internal automations to facilitate your team's day-to-day**: Reduce the amount of manual entries and repetitive tasks that slow down your team.
2. **Bring data in and out of Twenty**: Connect Twenty via API calls and webhooks to your database and other tools.

## Building Your First Workflow

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Go to **Workflows** accessible below the other objects
2. Click **+ New Record**
3. Give your workflow a name

### Step 2: Add a Trigger

Every workflow starts with a trigger. Choose from:

* **Record events**: When a record is created, updated, or deleted
* **Schedule**: Run at specific times (daily, weekly, etc.)
* **Manual**: Triggered by a user action
* **Webhook**: Triggered by a webhook

### Step 3: Add Actions

After your trigger, add one or more actions:

* **Create Record**: Add new records to any object
* **Update Record**: Modify existing record data
* **Delete Record**: Remove records from objects
* **Search Records**: Find records matching criteria
* **Upsert Record**: Create or update based on matching criteria
* **Iterator**: Loop through arrays of records
* **Filter**: Control which records proceed
* **Delay**: Wait before continuing (duration or scheduled date)
* **Send Email**: Send emails via your connected account
* **Code**: Run custom JavaScript
* **HTTP Request**: Call external APIs
* **Form**: Get inputs from users within Twenty UI at the time of execution
* **AI Agent** (Coming soon): Run intelligent AI tasks

### Step 4: Test and Activate

1. Use the **Test** button to run your workflow with sample data
2. Review the results to ensure it works as expected
3. Toggle the workflow **Active** when ready

## Workflow Best Practices

* **Edit step names**: Rename your workflow steps to clearly describe what each one does. This helps with maintenance and makes it easier to hand off to coworkers
* **Leverage previous step data**: You can use fields from records returned by any previous step in your workflow
* **Start simple**: Begin with basic workflows and add complexity over time as you become more comfortable with the system
* **Plan before building**: Map out your workflow logic before you start building to avoid getting stuck halfway through
