## Selecting Fields to Display

Each view can show a different set of fields. Customize what's visible to focus on the information that matters.

### Show or Hide Fields

1. Click **Options** in the top right
2. Click **Fields**
3. Click the **eye icon** next to each field to show/hide it

### Reorder Fields

Change the order fields appear in your view:

1. Click **Options → Fields**
2. Drag fields up or down
3. Changes save automatically

## Field Display by View Type

## Migliori Pratiche

* **Show only what's needed** — too many fields clutters the view
* **Put important fields first** — most-used columns on the left
* **Create multiple views** — different field sets for different purposes
* **Use field visibility per view** — same object, different focus
