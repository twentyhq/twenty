title: Use Branches in Workflows
description: Understand how branches work and how to control which path is executed.

## How Branches Work

In the workflow editor, you can create multiple paths (branches) going out from a single node. This allows you to build complex automations with different outcomes.

**Important**: When a workflow runs, **all branches execute in parallel by default**. There is no built-in "if/else" logic to choose one branch over another—every path will run simultaneously.

## Controlling Which Branch Runs

To execute only one branch based on specific conditions, **add a Filter node at the beginning of each branch**.

### Example Setup

1. Create your workflow with multiple branches from a single node
2. Add a **Filter** node as the first step in each branch
3. Set conditions on each Filter to determine when that branch should continue
4. Only the branch(es) whose Filter conditions are met will proceed

### How Filters Work

* If the Filter condition is **met**: The branch continues executing
* If the Filter condition is **not met**: The branch stops at the Filter node

This effectively creates conditional logic where only the appropriate branch runs based on your data.

## Example: Route by Deal Size

**Scenario**: When a deal is closed, send different notifications based on deal size.

1. **Trigger**: Opportunity updated (Stage = Closed Won)
2. **Branch 1**: Filter for Amount > $10,000 → Send Slack message to #big-deals
3. **Branch 2**: Filter for Amount ≤ $10,000 → Send email to sales manager

Both branches start, but only the one matching the deal amount will continue past its Filter.

## Creating Branches

<Note>
  To create a new branch from an existing step, click the **+** button on the step and add your action. You can add multiple branches by clicking **+** multiple times.
</Note>

1. In the workflow editor, select the step you want to branch from
2. Click the **+** button to add an action
3. This creates one branch
4. Click **+** again on the same step to create additional branches
5. Each branch can have its own sequence of actions

## Merging Branches Back Together

After parallel branches complete their work, you can merge them back into a single path:

1. Complete your branched actions
2. Add a new step that should run after all branches
3. Drag a connection from the last step of each branch to this new step
4. The merged step waits for all connected branches to complete before executing

### Example: Process Then Notify

```
Trigger
   │
   ├── Branch A: Update Customer Record
   │
   └── Branch B: Create Support Ticket

       ↘  ↙

   Merged Step: Send Confirmation Email
```

The confirmation email sends only after both the customer update and ticket creation are done.

## Migliori Pratiche

* Always use **Filter nodes** at the start of branches when you want conditional execution
* Keep branch conditions **mutually exclusive** to avoid duplicate actions
* Test your workflows with different data to ensure the correct branches run
* **Rename branch steps** descriptively so it's clear what each path does
* **Merge branches** when you need a final action after parallel processing
