## Problemi comuni e soluzioni

### Flusso di lavoro non attivato

**Symptoms**: Your workflow doesn't run when you expect it to.

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Workflow not activated**: Ensure the workflow is set to "Active" not "Draft"
2. **Trigger conditions not met**: Verify the trigger matches your expected event
3. **Field not monitored**: For "Record is Updated" triggers, ensure the specific field is being watched
4. **Permissions**: Check you have permission to run workflows

**Soluzioni**:

* Verify workflow status in the workflow list
* Test with the specific action you expect to trigger it
* Review trigger configuration
* Contact your admin about permissions

### Workflow Triggers Too Early (Empty Fields)

**Symptoms**: When manually creating a record in the UI, your workflow triggers before you've had time to fill in all the fields. The workflow runs with mostly empty field values.

**Why this happens**: Twenty saves everything in real-time — there's no separate "edit" vs "read" mode. When you create a record, it's saved immediately, triggering the "Record is created" event before you can fill in additional fields.

**When "Record is created" works well**:

* Records created via API calls (fields are populated in a single request)
* Records created via import
* Automated record creation from other workflows

**Solution**: For records created manually in the UI, use **"Record is created or updated"** as your trigger instead. This way:

* The workflow triggers after the user has finished filling in and saving the fields
* You get the complete data rather than empty values

<Tip>
  If you only want the workflow to run once per record, add a Filter action to check a field like `createdAt equals updatedAt` (first save) or use a custom checkbox field to track if the workflow has already run.
</Tip>

### Actions Failing

**Symptoms**: Workflow runs but some actions fail.

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Missing data**: Required fields are empty
2. **Invalid references**: Variables from previous steps don't exist
3. **API errors**: External services returning errors
4. **Permission issues**: Action requires permissions you don't have

**Soluzioni**:

* Check the workflow run details for error messages
* Verify all required fields have values
* Test API connections independently
* Review role permissions

### HTTP Request Errors

**Symptoms**: HTTP Request actions fail or return unexpected results.

**Common Error Codes**:

* **400**: Bad request - check your request body format
* **401**: Unauthorized - verify API key
* **403**: Forbidden - check API permissions
* **404**: Not found - verify endpoint URL
* **429**: Too many requests - implement rate limiting
* **500**: Server error - external service issue

**Soluzioni**:

* Verify API endpoint URL
* Check authentication headers
* Test the API call outside of Twenty first
* Add error handling in Code actions

### Code Action Errors

**Symptoms**: JavaScript code fails to execute.

**Common Issues**:

1. **Syntax errors**: Typos or invalid JavaScript
2. **Undefined variables**: Referencing variables that don't exist
3. **Type errors**: Operations on wrong data types
4. **Timeouts**: Code taking too long to execute

**Soluzioni**:

* Use the built-in code editor validation
* Test code logic in a JavaScript console first
* Add console.log statements for debugging
* Simplify complex operations

### Email Not Sending

**Symptoms**: Send Email action doesn't deliver emails.

**Possible Causes**:

1. **No email account connected**: Check Settings → Accounts
2. **Invalid email address**: Recipient email is malformed
3. **Sending limits**: Email provider rate limits reached
4. **Spam filters**: Emails being blocked

**Soluzioni**:

* Verify email account connection
* Validate recipient email addresses
* Check email provider limits
* Review email content for spam triggers

## Debugging Workflows

### Using Workflow Runs

1. Go to the workflow editor
2. Open the **Runs** panel
3. Find the failed run
4. Click to see step-by-step details
5. Review error messages and output data

### Testing Individual Steps

1. For Code actions, use the **Test** button
2. For HTTP requests, test the endpoint separately
3. Create test records to trigger workflows
4. Use manual triggers for controlled testing

### Common Debugging Patterns

**Add logging**:
Use Code actions to log intermediate values for debugging.

**Isolate steps**:
Test each step independently to identify failures.

**Check data flow**:
Verify that each step receives the expected input data.

## Best Practices to Avoid Issues

### Before Activation

* Test thoroughly in draft mode
* Validate all API connections
* Review trigger conditions carefully
* Document expected behavior

### During Development

* Use descriptive step names
* Add comments in Code actions
* Test with realistic data
* Plan for edge cases

### After Activation

* Monitor initial runs closely
* Set up alerts for failures
* Review run history regularly
* Keep workflows simple when possible
