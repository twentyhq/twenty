## What's Coming

Twenty is building AI capabilities to help your team work smarter. We're focusing on two major areas:

### 1. AI Chatbot

A conversational assistant that understands your context and has access to all your Twenty data.

**Key capabilities:**

* **Full data access**: Query any record, relationship, or metric in your workspace
* **Page context awareness**: Reference "this company" or "this opportunity" based on where you are in Twenty
* **Natural language**: Ask questions and get answers without navigating menus

**Example prompts:**

* "What opportunities are closing this month?"
* "Which deals have been in Negotiation for more than 30 days?"
* "Summarize my interactions with this person"

### 2. AI Agents in Workflows

Extend your workflows with AI-powered actions and autonomous agents.

**Key capabilities:**

* **AI actions**: Use AI to enrich data, classify records, generate summaries, and more
* **Autonomous agents**: Let agents execute multi-step tasks within a workflow
* **Custom prompts**: Define exactly how AI should process your data

**Use cases:**

* Automatically categorize inbound leads
* Enrich company data from public sources
* Generate follow-up email drafts based on meeting notes
* Score opportunities based on engagement patterns

## Permissions and Access Control

AI agents will be managed through the existing permissions system:

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Configure which data each AI agent can access
3. Set read/write permissions per object

This ensures AI agents respect your data governance policies and only access what they need.
