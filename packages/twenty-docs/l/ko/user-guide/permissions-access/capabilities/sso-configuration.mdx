## About SSO

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows your team members to log into Twenty using your organization's identity provider. This provides:

* **Centralized access control**: Manage access from one place
* **Enhanced security**: Leverage your existing security policies
* **Better user experience**: One set of credentials for all tools

## Supported Providers

Twenty supports SSO with:

* **SAML 2.0**: Works with most enterprise identity providers
* **Google Workspace**: For organizations using Google
* **Microsoft Entra ID**: (formerly Azure AD) For Microsoft environments

## Setting Up SSO

### Prerequisites

* Organization plan (cloud and self-hosted workspaces)
* Admin access to your identity provider
* Admin access to Twenty workspace

<Note>
  **For self-hosting users willing to set up SSO**, reach out to contact@twenty.com
</Note>

### Configuration Steps

#### 1. Access SSO Settings

1. Go to **Settings → Security**
2. Find the **SSO Configuration** section
3. Click **Configure SSO**

#### 2) Choose Your Provider

Select your identity provider from the list or choose "Custom SAML" for other providers.

#### 3. Configure Your Identity Provider

You'll need to configure your identity provider with:

* **Entity ID**: Provided by Twenty
* **ACS URL**: The callback URL for authentication
* **Certificate**: For secure communication

#### 4. Enter Provider Details in Twenty

* **SSO URL**: Login URL from your provider
* **Entity ID**: Your provider's identifier
* **Certificate**: X.509 certificate from your provider

#### 5. Test and Enable

1. Click **Test Configuration** to verify setup
2. Enable SSO when testing is successful
3. Configure user provisioning preferences

## User Provisioning

### Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning

* Users are created automatically on first login
* Assigned default role automatically
* No manual user creation needed

### Manual Provisioning

* Invite users before they can log in
* Pre-assign specific roles
* More control over who can access

## Managing SSO Users

### Role Assignment

SSO users can be assigned roles like regular users:

1. Go to **Settings → Members**
2. Find the user
3. Change their role as needed

### Access Revocation

To remove access for SSO users:

* Remove them from your identity provider, or
* Remove them from the Twenty workspace

## Best Practices

### Security

* **Require SSO**: Disable password login for SSO users
* **Regular audits**: Review access periodically
* **Strong IdP policies**: Enforce MFA at the identity provider

### User Management

* **Clear naming**: Use consistent naming from your directory
* **Group mapping**: Map IdP groups to Twenty roles (if available)
* **Offboarding process**: Include Twenty in your deprovisioning workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Certificate errors**: Ensure certificate hasn't expired
* **URL mismatches**: Verify ACS URL matches exactly
* **User not found**: Check JIT provisioning settings
