## Import Methods

Twenty supports two main methods for importing data:

| Method         | Best For                             | Volume Limit            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **CSV Import** | Standard migrations, regular updates | 10,000 records per file |
| **API Import** | Large-scale migrations, automation   | Unlimited               |

<Note>For very large datasets (hundreds of thousands of records), use the API. Our [implementation partners](/l/ko/user-guide/getting-started/capabilities/implementation-services) can help run these scripts if needed.</Note>

## CSV Import Basics

You can import data for any object using CSV, XLSX, or XLS files. Each file should contain **only one type of object** (e.g., only People records).

<Note>**Fields must exist before import.** Uploading a CSV creates records but does not create fields. If you need custom fields, create them first under **Settings → Data Model**.</Note>

### Steps

1. Navigate to the object where you want to import data
2. Click the **⋮** icon on the top right (this is the Command Menu) and click on **Import records**
3. Download the template file to ensure your data is in the expected format
4. Upload your formatted CSV file
5. Map your columns to Twenty fields
6. Review errors (highlighted in yellow) and fix them, directly editing in the UI
7. Confirm the import

### Importing relations between objects

You can import relations between objects using the csv import function. You need to reference the related object using a unique field from this object: the `id`, the `email` for People and Workspace Members, the `domain` for companies, any other field set as unique in the data model for any other object.

<Note>**Deleted records count toward uniqueness.** Soft-deleted records (visible under Command Menu → See deleted records) are included in uniqueness checks. If you import a record with the same unique value as a deleted record, the deleted record will be restored.</Note>

<Warning>
  **Import Order Matters!**

  When importing related objects, upload files in this order:

  1. **Companies** first (the "one" side of relationships)
  2. **People** second (linked to companies via companyId)
  3. **Opportunities** third (linked to companies/people)
  4. **Custom objects** with relations last

  Why? The "one" side of a one-to-many relationship must exist before you can reference it. For example, the Company record must exist before you import a Person with that company's ID.
</Warning>

Please refer to [this article](/l/ko/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-relations-between-objects-via-csv) for a step-by-step guide on how to proceed.

## Export Data

Export your workspace data for backups, reporting, or migration.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the object you want to export
2. Configure the view with the columns you need
3. Click **⋮** → **Export view**
4. Save the CSV file

<Note>**Only visible columns are exported.** The CSV file will only contain the columns displayed in your current view. Add or hide columns before exporting to control what data is included.</Note>

<Note>**Export limits**: Up to 20,000 records per export.</Note>

## Permissions

Data import and export require specific permissions:

* **Import**: Requires "Import CSV" permission
* **Export**: Requires "Export CSV" permission

Contact your workspace admin if you don't have these permissions.
