title: Display Related Record Data
description: Show data from related records (e.g., Company info on Opportunities) using workflows.
---

Display data from related records directly on your records — for example, show the employee count from a Company on its Opportunities. This workflow workaround is useful until nested fields are natively available.

## Common Use Cases

| Source      | Destination | Fields to Copy                  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Company     | Opportunity | Industry, Company Size, ARR     |
| Person      | Opportunity | Email, Phone, Title             |
| Opportunity | Company     | Last Deal Amount, Last Won Date |

## Basic Field Copy

### Example: Copy Contact Email to Opportunity

**Goal**: When setting a Point of Contact on an opportunity, copy their email to the opportunity for easy access.

### Prerequisite

Create the destination fields in **Settings → Data Model → Opportunities** before building the workflow:

* Contact Email (type: Email)
* Contact Phone (type: Phone)

### Setup

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (Opportunities, Point of Contact field)

2. **Filter**: Check that Point of Contact is not empty

3. **Search Records**: Find the linked person
   * Object: People
   * Filter: ID equals `{{trigger.object.pointOfContact.id}}`

4. **Update Record**:
   * Object: Opportunities
   * Record: `{{trigger.object.id}}`
   * Contact Email: `{{searchRecords[0].email}}`
   * Contact Phone: `{{searchRecords[0].phone}}`

## Copy Multiple Fields

### Example: Sync Company Info to All Related Opportunities

**Goal**: When company details change, update all related opportunities.

### Setup

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (Companies)
   * Fields: Industry, Company Size, Annual Revenue

2. **Search Records**: Find all opportunities for this company
   * Object: Opportunities
   * Filter: Company ID equals `{{trigger.object.id}}`

3. **Iterator**: Loop through each opportunity

4. **Update Record** (inside iterator):
   * Object: Opportunities
   * Record: `{{iterator.currentItem.id}}`
   * Company Industry: `{{trigger.object.industry}}`
   * Company Size: `{{trigger.object.companySize}}`
   * Company ARR: `{{trigger.object.annualRevenue}}`

## Copy on Record Creation

### Example: Pre-fill Opportunity with Company Data

**Goal**: When creating an opportunity linked to a company, automatically copy key company info.

### Prerequisite

Create the destination fields in **Settings → Data Model → Opportunities**:

* Company Industry (type: Text)
* Company Size (type: Number)

### Setup

1. **Trigger**: Record is Created (Opportunities)
   * Filter: Company is not empty

2. **Search Records**: Get the linked company's details
   * Object: Companies
   * Filter: ID equals `{{trigger.object.company.id}}`

3. **Update Record**:
   * Object: Opportunities
   * Record: `{{trigger.object.id}}`
   * Company Industry: `{{searchRecords[0].industry}}`
   * Company Size: `{{searchRecords[0].employees}}`

<Note>
  **Tasks and Notes limitation**: Relations on Tasks and Notes are hardcoded as many-to-many and are not yet available in workflow triggers or actions. To access these relations, use the [API](/l/ko/developers/extend/capabilities/apis) instead.
</Note>

## Bidirectional Sync

### Example: Keep Primary Contact in Sync

**Goal**: When a company's primary contact changes, update the contact. When a person becomes primary, update the company.

### Workflow 1: Company → Person

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (Companies, Primary Contact field)
2. **Update Record**: Set person's "Is Primary Contact" to true
3. **Search Records**: Find previous primary contact
4. **Update Record**: Set previous contact's "Is Primary Contact" to false

### Workflow 2: Person → Company

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (People, Is Primary Contact = true)
2. **Update Record**: Set company's Primary Contact to this person

<Note>
  Be careful with bidirectional syncs to avoid infinite loops. Use filters to check if the value actually changed before updating.
</Note>

## Using Code for Complex Mapping

### Example: Transform Data During Copy

**Goal**: Copy and format phone number from person to opportunity.

```javascript
export const main = async (params) => {
  const { phone } = params;

  if (!phone) return { formattedPhone: null };

  // Remove non-numeric characters
  const digits = phone.replace(/\D/g, '');

  // Format as (XXX) XXX-XXXX
  const formatted = digits.length === 10
    ? `(${digits.slice(0,3)}) ${digits.slice(3,6)}-${digits.slice(6)}`
    : phone;

  return { formattedPhone: formatted };
};
```

## Best Practices

### Avoid Loops

* Don't create workflows that trigger each other endlessly
* Use specific field conditions
* Add checks to see if value actually changed

### Handle Missing Data

* Always check if source record exists before copying
* Provide default values for optional fields
* Use filters to skip when source field is empty

### Performance

* Batch updates when copying to many records
* Use scheduled workflows for bulk sync operations
* Consider using Iterator for multiple record updates
