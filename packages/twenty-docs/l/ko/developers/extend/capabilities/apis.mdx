Twenty was built to be developer-friendly, offering powerful APIs that adapt to your custom data model. We provide four distinct API types to meet different integration needs.

## Developer-First Approach

Twenty generates APIs specifically for your data model:

* **No long IDs required**: Use your object and field names directly in endpoints
* **Standard and custom objects treated equally**: Your custom objects get the same API treatment as built-in ones
* **Dedicated endpoints**: Each object and field gets its own API endpoint
* **Custom documentation**: Generated specifically for your workspace's data model

<Note>
  Your personalized API documentation is available under **Settings → API & Webhooks** after creating an API key. Since Twenty generates APIs that match your custom data model, the documentation is unique to your workspace.
</Note>

## The Two API Types

### Core API

Accessed on `/rest/` or `/graphql/`

Work with your actual **records** (the data):

* Create, read, update, delete People, Companies, Opportunities, etc.
* Query and filter data
* Manage record relationships

### Metadata API

Accessed on `/rest/metadata/` or `/metadata/`

Manage your **workspace and data model**:

* Create, modify, or delete objects and fields
* Configure workspace settings
* Define relationships between objects

## REST vs GraphQL

Both Core and Metadata APIs are available in REST and GraphQL formats:

| Format      | Available Operations                                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **REST**    | CRUD, batch operations, upserts                            |
| **GraphQL** | Same + **batch upserts**, relationship queries in one call |

Choose based on your needs — both formats access the same data.

## API Endpoints

| Environment     | Base URL                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Cloud**       | `https://api.twenty.com/` |
| **Self-Hosted** | `https://{your-domain}/`  |

## Authentication

Every API request requires an API key in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Create an API Key

1. Go to **Settings → APIs & Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Create key**
3. Configure:
   * **Name**: Descriptive name for the key
   * **Expiration Date**: When the key expires
4. Click **Save**
5. **Copy immediately** — the key is only shown once

<Warning>
  Your API key grants access to sensitive data. Don't share it with untrusted services. If compromised, disable it immediately and generate a new one.
</Warning>

### Assign a Role to an API Key

For better security, assign a specific role to limit access:

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Click on the role to assign
3. Open the **Assignment** tab
4. Under **API Keys**, click **+ Assign to API key**
5. Select the API key

The key will inherit that role's permissions. See [Permissions](/l/ko/user-guide/permissions-access/capabilities/permissions) for details.

### Manage API Keys

**Regenerate**: Settings → APIs & Webhooks → Click key → **Regenerate**

**Delete**: Settings → APIs & Webhooks → Click key → **Delete**

## API Playground

Test your APIs directly in the browser with our built-in playground — available for both **REST** and **GraphQL**.

### Access the Playground

1. Go to **Settings → APIs & Webhooks**
2. Create an API key (required)
3. Click on **REST API** or **GraphQL API** to open the playground

### What You Get

* **Interactive documentation**: Generated for your specific data model
* **Live testing**: Execute real API calls against your workspace
* **Schema explorer**: Browse available objects, fields, and relationships
* **Request builder**: Construct queries with autocomplete

The playground reflects your custom objects and fields, so documentation is always accurate for your workspace.

## Batch Operations

Both REST and GraphQL support batch operations:

* **Batch size**: Up to 60 records per request
* **Operations**: Create, update, delete multiple records

**GraphQL-only features:**

* **Batch Upsert**: Create or update in one call
* Use plural object names (e.g., `CreateCompanies` instead of `CreateCompany`)

## Rate Limits

API requests are throttled to ensure platform stability:

| Limit          | Value                |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Requests**   | 100 calls per minute |
| **Batch size** | 60 records per call  |

<Tip>
  Use batch operations to maximize throughput — process up to 60 records in a single API call instead of making individual requests.
