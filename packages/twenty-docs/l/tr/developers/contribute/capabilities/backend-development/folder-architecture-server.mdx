info: A detailed look into our server folder architecture
---

The backend directory structure is as follows:

```
server
  └───ability
  └───constants
  └───core
  └───database
  └───decorators
  └───filters
  └───guards
  └───health
  └───integrations
  └───metadata
  └───workspace
  └───utils
```

## Ability

Defines permissions and includes handlers for each entity.

## Decorators

Defines custom decorators in NestJS for added functionality.

See [custom decorators](https://docs.nestjs.com/custom-decorators) for more details.

## Filtreler

Includes exception filters to handle exceptions that might occur in GraphQL endpoints.

## Guards

See [guards](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards) for more details.

## Health

Includes a publicly available REST API (healthz) that returns a JSON to confirm whether the database is working as expected.

## Meta Veriler

Defines custom objects and makes available a GraphQL API (graphql/metadata).

## İş Alanı

Generates and serves custom GraphQL schema based on the metadata.

### Workspace Directory Structure

  └───workspace.factory.spec.ts
  └───workspace.factory.ts
```

The root of the workspace directory includes the `workspace.factory.ts`, a file containing the `createGraphQLSchema` function. This function generates workspace-specific schema by using the metadata to tailor a schema for individual workspaces. By separating the schema and resolver construction, we use the `makeExecutableSchema` function, which combines these discrete elements.

This strategy is not just about organization, but also helps with optimization, such as caching generated type definitions to enhance performance and scalability.

### Workspace Schema builder

Generates the GraphQL schema, and includes:

#### Factories:

Specialised constructors to generate GraphQL-related constructs.

* The type.factory translates field metadata into GraphQL types using `TypeMapperService`.
* The type-definition.factory creates GraphQL input or output objects derived from `objectMetadata`.

#### GraphQL Types

Includes enumerations, inputs, objects, and scalars, and serves as the building blocks for the schema construction.

#### Interfaces and Object Definitions

Contains the blueprints for GraphQL entities, and includes both predefined and custom types like `MONEY` or `URL`.

#### Services

Contains the service responsible for associating FieldMetadataType with its appropriate GraphQL scalar or query modifiers.

#### Storage

Includes the `TypeDefinitionsStorage` class that contains reusable type definitions, preventing duplication of GraphQL types.

### Workspace Resolver Builder

Creates resolver functions for querying and mutating the GraphQL schema.

Each factory in this directory is responsible for producing a distinct resolver type, such as the `FindManyResolverFactory`, designed for adaptable application across various tables.
