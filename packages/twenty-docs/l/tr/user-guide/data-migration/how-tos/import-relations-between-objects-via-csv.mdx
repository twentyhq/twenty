title: Import Relations Between Objects via CSV
description: Complete step-by-step guide to linking records during CSV import.
---

## Genel Bakış

This guide walks you through importing relations between objects—for example, linking People to Companies, or Opportunities to People.

<Note>**What can be imported:** Only one-to-many relations pointing to a single object type. Relations pointing to multiple object types (like Notes linking to People AND Companies) are not yet supported for import.</Note>

## Understanding Relations

### What is a "One-to-Many" Relation?

In a one-to-many relation:

* **One** Company has **many** People (employees)
* **One** Company has **many** Opportunities
* **One** Person has **many** Tasks

The "one" side is the **parent**. The "many" side is the **child**.

### Common Relations in Twenty

| İlişki                    | "One" Side (Parent) | "Many" Side (Child) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Companies → People        | Şirket              | İnsanlar            |
| Companies → Opportunities | Şirket              | Fırsatlar           |
| People → Tasks            | Kişi                | Görevler            |
| People → Notes            | Kişi                | Notlar              |

## Step 1: Identify the "One" and "Many" Sides

Before importing, determine which object is the parent and which is the child.

**Ask yourself:** "Does ONE [Object A] have MANY [Object B]?"

* One Company → Many People ✓ (Company is parent)
* One Person → Many Companies ✗ (This is wrong—a person belongs to one company)

## Step 2: Import the Parent Records First

The parent ("one" side) must exist in Twenty before you can reference it.

**Import order:**

1. **Companies** first (no dependencies)
2. **People** second (link to Companies)
3. **Opportunities** third (link to Companies and/or People)
4. **Tasks/Notes** (link to any of the above)

<Warning>
  **If the parent record doesn't exist, the import will fail.**

  Always verify that Companies are imported before importing People with company references.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Note the Parent's Unique Identifier

You need to reference the parent record using a **unique identifier**. Available options:

| Parent Object             | Available Unique Identifiers                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Şirketler**             | `id` (UUID), `domain` (recommended), or any custom unique field |
| **People**                | `id` (UUID), `email`, or any custom unique field                |
| **Çalışma Alanı Üyeleri** | `id` (UUID), `email` (not name)                                 |
| **Özel Nesneler**         | `id` (UUID), or any field marked as unique                      |

<Note>**Recommended:** Use `domain` for Companies and `email` for People. These are human-readable and easy to verify in your spreadsheet.</Note>

### Finding the Identifier

If you need the `id`:

1. Export the parent records from Twenty
2. The export includes the `id` column
3. Use these IDs in your child records file

## Step 4: Verify the Relation Field Exists

Before importing, ensure the relation field exists between your objects.

**To check or create:**

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select your child object (e.g., People)
3. Look for a relation field pointing to the parent (e.g., Company)
4. If it doesn't exist, create it:
   * Click **+ Add field**
   * Select **Relation** type
   * Choose the parent object

## Step 5: Prepare Your CSV File

Add a column to your child CSV that references the parent using its unique identifier.

### Example: People Linking to Companies

**Your People CSV:**

```csv
firstName,lastName,email,jobTitle,companyDomain
John,Smith,john@acme.com,CEO,https://acme.com
Jane,Doe,jane@widgets.co,CTO,https://widgets.co
Bob,Johnson,bob@techstart.io,Developer,https://techstart.io
```

The `companyDomain` column references the Company's domain.

### Format Requirements

| Tanımlayıcı | Biçim          | Örnek                                  |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Alan Adı    | URL format     | `https://acme.com`                     |
| E-posta     | Standard email | `john@acme.com`                        |
| Kimlik      | UUID           | `c776ee49-f608-4a77-8cc8-6fe96ae1e43f` |

<Warning>
  **Domain format matters!**

  Use `https://domain.com` (not just `domain.com`). This matches how Twenty stores Company domains and prevents matching errors.
</Warning>

### Important Rules

1. **Exact match required** — the value must exactly match the parent record
2. **Map only ONE unique identifier** — don't include both `companyId` AND `companyDomain`
3. **Case sensitive** — `Acme.com` ≠ `acme.com`

## Step 6: Upload and Map the Relation

1. Navigate to the child object (e.g., People)
2. Click **⋮** → **Import records**
3. Upload your CSV file
4. In the field mapping step:
   * Find your relation column (e.g., `companyDomain`)
   * Map it to the **Company** relation field
5. Complete the remaining mapping
6. Review errors and confirm

Twenty will automatically link each child record to the matching parent.

## Step 7: Verify the Import

After importing:

1. Open a few child records (e.g., People)
2. Verify the relation field shows the correct parent (e.g., Company)
3. Open a parent record and check the related records section

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                    | Problem                                            | Solution                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wrong import order**     | Importing People before Companies                  | Always import parents first, then children              |
| **Wrong domain format**    | Using `acme.com` instead of `https://acme.com`     | Use full URL format with `https://`                     |
| **Multiple unique fields** | Mapping both `companyId` AND `companyDomain`       | Map only ONE unique identifier                          |
| **Missing relation field** | The relation field doesn't exist in the data model | Create it in **Settings → Data Model** before importing |
| **Non-existent records**   | The parent record doesn't exist in Twenty          | Import parent records first, or check for typos         |
| **Case mismatch**          | `Acme.com` in file but `acme.com` in Twenty        | Ensure exact case matching                              |

## Linking to Workspace Members

When linking to Workspace Members (your team):

* Use their **email address**, not their name
* Example: `owner@yourcompany.com`, not "John Smith"

```csv
taskName,assignedTo
Follow up with client,john@yourcompany.com
Review proposal,jane@yourcompany.com
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if my parent record doesn't have a domain or email?">
    You have two options:

    1. Use the Twenty `id` (export parent records to get their IDs)
    2. Create a custom unique field in your data model to store an external ID from your previous system
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update relations on existing records?">
    Evet! Include the child record's unique identifier (e.g., `email` for People) and the new relation value. The import will update the relation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import Many-to-Many relationships?">
    Many-to-Many relations are not yet supported for import. This is planned for H1 2026.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I link to multiple object types (like Notes to People AND Companies)?">
    Relations pointing to multiple object types are not yet supported for import/export. This is on our roadmap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a parent record doesn't exist?">
    The import will show an error for that row. Aşağıdakileri yapabilirsiniz:

    * Import the parent record first, then re-import
    * Fix the reference value
    * Remove the row from import
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is my relation not linking correctly?">
    Common causes:

    * Wrong format (use `https://domain.com` for domains)
    * Case mismatch (check exact spelling)
    * Parent doesn't exist (import parents first)
    * Mapping multiple identifiers (use only one)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Remember: Soft-deleted records count toward uniqueness.**

  If you're getting "not found" errors but the record seems to exist, check Command Menu → See deleted records. The parent may have been soft-deleted.
</Warning>
