description: Step-by-step guide to migrate your data from any CRM to Twenty.
---

## Genel Bakış

This guide walks you through migrating your data from any CRM to Twenty. The process involves auditing your data, preparing your Twenty workspace, exporting from your current system, and importing into Twenty.

<Note>Views, workflows, and permissions must be recreated manually after migration. Plan time for this configuration work.</Note>

## Step 1: Audit Your Current Data

Migration is an opportunity for a fresh start. Don't bring over clutter.

**What to keep:**

* Active contacts and companies
* Open opportunities and deals
* Important notes and activities
* Custom fields you actually use

**What to leave behind:**

* Outdated contacts (no activity in 2+ years)
* Duplicate records
* Test data
* Unused custom fields

## Step 2: Map Your Data Model

Create a mapping document between your current CRM and Twenty:

| Your CRM               | Twenty               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Account / Organization | **Company**          |
| Contact / Person       | **People**           |
| Deal / Opportunity     | **Opportunity**      |
| Activity               | **Task** or **Note** |
| Custom Object          | **Custom Object**    |

**For each field, document:**

* The source field name
* The target Twenty field
* Any format transformations needed (dates, phone numbers, etc.)

<Note>Keep this mapping document handy during import—you'll reference it when mapping columns.</Note>

## Step 3: Set Up Your Twenty Workspace

Before importing data, prepare your Twenty workspace:

### Create Custom Objects and Fields

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Create any custom objects you need
3. Add custom fields to standard and custom objects
4. Configure field settings (unique, required, select options, etc.)

<Warning>
  **Fields must exist before import.**

  The CSV import creates records, not fields. Create all custom fields in Settings → Data Model before importing.
</Warning>

### Invite Your Team

<Warning>
  **Invite users BEFORE importing data.**

  If your data includes user references (Account Owner, Assignee, etc.), those users must exist in Twenty before import. Otherwise, those relations cannot be mapped.
</Warning>

1. **Ayarlar → Üyeler** bölümüne gidin
2. Invite all team members
3. **Wait for everyone to accept** their invitation
4. Verify all users appear in your Members list

## Step 4: Export from Your Current CRM

Export your data from your current CRM:

1. Look for an **Export** function (usually under Settings, Data Management, or Admin)
2. Export to **CSV format** when possible
3. Export each object type separately (Companies, Contacts, Deals, etc.)
4. Include all fields you want to migrate

**Export these objects (in this order for reference):**

1. Companies / Accounts / Organizations
2. Contacts / People
3. Deals / Opportunities
4. Notes and Activities
5. Özel nesneler

## Step 5: Clean and Format Your Data

Open each exported CSV in a spreadsheet application and prepare it for Twenty.

### Remove Duplicates

1. Sort by the unique field (email for People, domain for Companies)
2. Remove or merge duplicate rows
3. Verify no duplicates exist in Twenty already

### Format Fields Correctly

| Field Type        | Required Format                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**        | `https://domain.com`                              |
| **E-posta**       | `name@domain.com` (must be unique)                |
| **Date**          | `YYYY-MM-DD`                                      |
| **Phone**         | Three columns: Number, Country Code, Calling Code |
| **Boolean**       | `TRUE` or `FALSE` (uppercase)                     |
| **Select fields** | Use API names, not display labels                 |

<Warning>
  **Domain format is critical.**

  Use `https://domain.com` (not `domain.com` or `www.domain.com`). This matches Twenty's format and prevents duplicates when you connect email/calendar sync.
</Warning>

See [How to Prepare Your CSV Files](/l/tr/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/prepare-your-csv-files) for complete formatting requirements for all field types.

### Add Relation Columns

To link records (e.g., People to Companies), add a column with the parent's unique identifier.

**Example: People CSV with Company link**

```csv
firstName,lastName,email,companyDomain
John,Smith,john@acme.com,https://acme.com
Jane,Doe,jane@widgets.co,https://widgets.co
```

See [How to Import Relations](/l/tr/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-relations-between-objects-via-csv) for detailed instructions on linking records.

### Update User References

If your data includes user assignments (Owner, Assignee):

1. Add a column with the **user's email** (not just their ID from the old system)
2. Use the same email addresses that users used to join your Twenty workspace

See [How to Prepare Your CSV Files](/l/tr/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/prepare-your-csv-files) for complete formatting guide.

## Step 6: Import to Twenty

<Warning>
  **Import Order Matters!**

  Always import in this order:

  1. **Companies** first (no dependencies)
  2. **People** second (link to Companies)
  3. **Opportunities** third (link to Companies/People)
  4. **Notes and Tasks** (link to records)
  5. **Custom objects** following their dependencies

  The parent record must exist before you can reference it.
</Warning>

### Import Each Object

For each CSV file, in order:

1. Navigate to the object in Twenty
2. Click **⋮ → Import records**
3. Upload the CSV file
4. Map columns to fields:
   * Map user email columns to the appropriate relation fields
   * Map relation columns (like `companyDomain`) to relation fields
5. Review and fix any errors in the UI
6. Confirm the import
7. Verify a few records before proceeding to the next file

* [How to Import Relations](/l/tr/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-relations-between-objects-via-csv)

## Step 7: Large Migrations (50,000+ Records)

For large migrations:

| Volume                  | Recommended Approach          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Under 10,000 records    | Single CSV import             |
| 10,000 - 50,000 records | Split into multiple CSV files |
| 50,000+ records         | Use the API                   |

**For API imports:**

* Faster and more reliable for large datasets
* Supports batch operations (up to 60 records per call)
* See [How to Import Data via API](/l/tr/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-data-via-api)

## Step 8: Post-Migration Setup

After importing data, complete your workspace configuration:

### Recreate Views

* Set up saved views with filters, sorts, and column configurations
* Create any kanban or calendar views you need

### Recreate Workflows

* Rebuild your automations in **Settings → Workflows**
* Start with the most critical workflows
* Test each one before relying on it

### Configure Roles and Permissions

* Set up roles in **Settings → Roles**
* Assign users to appropriate roles

### Connect Email and Calendar

* Each user connects their own account in **Settings → Accounts**
* Twenty will start syncing emails to contact records
* See [Email & Calendar](/l/tr/user-guide/calendar-emails/overview)

### Train Your Team

* Walk through the new interface together
* Document any team-specific processes

| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Duplicate errors**    | Email/domain already exists | Remove duplicates from file, or include unique identifier to update existing records |
| **Relation not found**  | Parent record doesn't exist | Import parent objects first (Companies before People)                                |
| **Missing fields**      | Custom field doesn't exist  | Create field in Settings → Data Model before importing                               |
| **Select field errors** | Using display labels        | Use API names (enable Advanced mode in Settings to find them)                        |
| **User relation empty** | User hasn't accepted invite | Ensure all users accept invitations before importing                                 |
