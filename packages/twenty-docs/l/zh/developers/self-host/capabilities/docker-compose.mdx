## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and configure the Twenty application using Docker Compose. The aim is to make the process straightforward and prevent common pitfalls that could break your setup.

**Important:** Only modify settings explicitly mentioned in this guide. Altering other configurations may lead to issues.

See docs [Setup Environment Variables](/l/zh/developers/self-host/capabilities/setup) for advanced configuration. All environment variables must be declared in the docker-compose.yml file at the server and / or worker level depending on the variable.

## System Requirements

* RAM: Ensure your environment has at least 2GB of RAM. Insufficient memory can cause processes to crash.
* Docker & Docker Compose: Make sure both are installed and up-to-date.

## Option 1: One-line script

Install the latest stable version of Twenty with a single command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/scripts/install.sh)
```

To install a specific version or branch:

```bash
VERSION=vx.y.z BRANCH=branch-name bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/scripts/install.sh)
```

* Replace x.y.z with the desired version number.
* Replace branch-name with the name of the branch you want to install.

## Option 2: Manual steps

Follow these steps for a manual setup.

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment File

1. **Create the .env File**

   Copy the example environment file to a new .env file in your working directory:

   ```bash
   curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/refs/heads/main/packages/twenty-docker/.env.example
   ```

2. **Generate Secret Tokens**

   Run the following command to generate a unique random string:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   **Important:** Keep this value secret / do not share it.

3. **Update the `.env`**

   Replace the placeholder value in your .env file with the generated token:

   ```ini
   APP_SECRET=first_random_string
   ```

4. **Set the Postgres Password**

   Update the `PG_DATABASE_PASSWORD` value in the .env file with a strong password without special characters.

   ```ini
   PG_DATABASE_PASSWORD=my_strong_password
   ```

### Step 2: Obtain the Docker Compose File

Download the `docker-compose.yml` file to your working directory:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/refs/heads/main/packages/twenty-docker/docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 3: Launch the Application

Start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Access the Application

If you host twentyCRM on your own computer, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If you host it on a server, check that the server is running and that everything is ok with

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## Configuration

### Expose Twenty to External Access

By default, Twenty runs on `localhost` at port `3000`. To access it via an external domain or IP address, you need to configure the `SERVER_URL` in your `.env` file.

#### Understanding `SERVER_URL`

* **Protocol:** Use `http` or `https` depending on your setup.
  * Use `http` if you haven't set up SSL.
  * Use `https` if you have SSL configured.
* **Domain/IP:** This is the domain name or IP address where your application is accessible.
* **Port:** Include the port number if you're not using the default ports (`80` for `http`, `443` for `https`).

### SSL Requirements

SSL (HTTPS) is required for certain browser features to work properly. While these features might work during local development (as browsers treat localhost differently), a proper SSL setup is needed when hosting Twenty on a regular domain.

For example, the clipboard API might require a secure context - some features like copy buttons throughout the application might not work without HTTPS enabled.

We strongly recommend setting up Twenty behind a reverse proxy with SSL termination for optimal security and functionality.

#### Configuring `SERVER_URL`

1. **Determine Your Access URL**
   * **Without Reverse Proxy (Direct Access):**

     If you're accessing the application directly without a reverse proxy:

     ```ini
     SERVER_URL=http://your-domain-or-ip:3000
     ```

   * **With Reverse Proxy (Standard Ports):**

     If you're using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik and have SSL configured:

     ```ini
     SERVER_URL=https://your-domain-or-ip
     ```

   * **With Reverse Proxy (Custom Ports):**

     If you're using non-standard ports:

     ```ini
     SERVER_URL=https://your-domain-or-ip:custom-port
     ```

2. **Update the `.env` File**

   Open your `.env` file and update the `SERVER_URL`:

   ```ini
   SERVER_URL=http(s)://your-domain-or-ip:your-port
   ```

   **Examples:**

   * Direct access without SSL:
     ```ini
     SERVER_URL=http://123.45.67.89:3000
     ```
   * Access via domain with SSL:
     ```ini
     SERVER_URL=https://mytwentyapp.com
     ```

3. **Restart the Application**

   For changes to take effect, restart the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

#### Considerations

* **Reverse Proxy Configuration:**

  Ensure your reverse proxy forwards requests to the correct internal port (`3000` by default). Configure SSL termination and any necessary headers.

* **Firewall Settings:**

  Open necessary ports in your firewall to allow external access.

* **Consistency:**

  The `SERVER_URL` must match how users access your application in their browsers.

#### Persistence

* **Data Volumes:**

  The Docker Compose configuration uses volumes to persist data for the database and server storage.

* **Stateless Environments:**

  If deploying to a stateless environment (e.g., certain cloud services), configure external storage to persist data.

## Backup and Restore

Regular backups protect your CRM data from loss.

### Create a Database Backup

```bash
docker exec twenty-postgres pg_dump -U postgres twenty > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### Automate Daily Backups

Add to your crontab (`crontab -e`):

```bash
0 2 * * * docker exec twenty-postgres pg_dump -U postgres twenty > /backups/twenty_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql
```

### Restore from Backup

1. Stop the application:

```bash
docker compose stop twenty-server twenty-front
```

2. Restore the database:

```bash
docker exec -i twenty-postgres psql -U postgres twenty < backup_20240115.sql
```

3. Restart services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Backup Best Practices

* **Test restores regularly** — verify backups actually work
* **Store backups off-site** — use cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)
* **Encrypt sensitive data** — protect backups with encryption
* **Retain multiple copies** — keep daily, weekly, and monthly backups
