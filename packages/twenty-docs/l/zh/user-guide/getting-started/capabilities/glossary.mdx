## API

API (Application Programming Interface) allows you to connect Twenty with other software systems and build custom integrations.

## Apps

Apps are custom extensions built as code that can define data models and serverless functions. They enable developers to create reusable customizations that can be deployed across multiple workspaces.

## Code Actions

Code Actions are workflow steps that let you write custom JavaScript to transform data, make calculations, or perform complex logic that isn't possible with built-in actions.

## Command Menu

The Command Menu is a quick-access interface (opened with `Cmd + K` on Mac and `Ctrl + K` on Windows) that lets you perform actions, create records, and navigate your workspace efficiently.

## Company & People

The CRM has two fundamental types of records:

* A `Company` represents a business or organization.
* `People` represent your company's current and prospective customers or clients.

## Custom Fields

Custom Fields are data fields you create to capture information specific to your business needs and processes.

## Data Model

A Data Model is the structure that defines how information is organized in your CRM, including what objects exist, their properties (fields), and how they relate to each other.

## Favorites

Favorites are records you've marked for quick access, appearing in your sidebar for instant navigation to important data.

## Field

A field refers to a specific area where particular data is stored for an entity.

## Integration

Integrations are built-in tools that allow you to link Twenty with other software or systems.

## Iterator

An Iterator is a workflow action that loops through an array of items, executing subsequent actions for each item in the list.

## Kanban

A `Kanban` is a visual way to track your business processes using cards and columns. Each column represents a stage in your process (for example: new, ongoing, won, lost), and you move records through these stages as they progress.

## Object

An Object is a data structure that represents a specific type of entity in your CRM (like People, Companies, or Opportunities). Objects can be standard (built-in) or custom (created by you).

## Opportunities

Opportunities in Twenty CRM are potential deals or sales with accounts or contacts.

## Record

A Record indicates an instance of an object, like a specific account or contact.

## Relation Fields

Relation Fields create connections between different objects, allowing you to link records together (like connecting a Person to a Company).

## Standard Fields

Standard Fields are pre-built data fields that come with objects by default and provide common functionality across all workspaces.

## Tasks

Tasks in Twenty CRM are assigned activities relating to contacts, accounts, or opportunities.

## Triggers

Triggers are the starting point of a workflow — the event or condition that initiates the automation. Examples include record creation, record updates, webhooks, or scheduled times.

## Views

You can customize the display of your records using views, setting different filters, layouts and sorting options for each view.

## Upsert

Upsert is an operation that combines "update" and "insert" — it updates an existing record if a match is found, or creates a new record if no match exists.

## Webhooks

Webhooks are automated messages sent from Twenty to other applications when specific events occur, enabling real-time data synchronization.

## Workflows

Workflows are automated processes that trigger actions based on specific conditions, helping you automate repetitive tasks and business processes.

## Workspace

A `Workspace` typically represents a company using Twenty. It holds all the records and data that you and your team members add to Twenty.
It has a single domain name, which is typically the domain name your company uses for employee email addresses.

## Workspace Members

Workspace Members are the Twenty users from your team who have access to your workspace. They can be assigned as owners or assignees for records.
