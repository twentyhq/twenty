Configure domain settings under **Settings → Domains**.

## Workspace Domain

Edit your subdomain name or set a custom domain for your workspace.

### 自定义域名

1. Click **Customize Domain**
2. Edit your subdomain (e.g., `yourcompany.twenty.com`)
3. Or set up a custom domain (e.g., `crm.yourcompany.com`)

For custom domains, you'll need to configure DNS settings with your domain provider.

## 批准的域名

Anyone with an email address at these domains is allowed to sign up for this workspace automatically.

### 添加批准的访问域

1. Click **Add Approved Access Domain**
2. Enter your company domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`)
3. 保存

Once configured, anyone with an email address at that domain can join your workspace without needing a direct invitation.

<Note>
  This is useful for allowing your entire team to self-register while keeping the workspace restricted to your organization.

在这些域名上提供一个完整且安全的托管环境。

### Add Public Domain

1. Click **Add Public Domain**
2. Enter the domain you want to use
