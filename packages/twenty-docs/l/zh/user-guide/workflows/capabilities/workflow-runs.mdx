## About Runs

A **Run** is a record of a workflow execution. Every time a workflow is triggered—whether by a record event, schedule, manual action, or webhook—a new run is created.

## Viewing Runs

### From the Workflow Editor

1. Open the workflow you want to monitor
2. Click the **Runs** panel on the right side
3. See a list of recent runs with their status

### From the Workflow Runs View

1. Go to **Workflow Runs** in the sidebar
2. View runs across all workflows
3. Filter by status, workflow, or date

## Run Statuses

| Status        | Description                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Running**   | Workflow is currently executing                                          |
| **Completed** | Workflow finished successfully                                           |
| **Failed**    | Workflow encountered an error and stopped                                |
| **Waiting**   | Workflow is paused (e.g., waiting for a Delay action or Form submission) |

## Run Details

Click on any run to see:

* **Status**: Current state of the run
* **Started at**: When the run began
* **Duration**: How long the run took
* **Trigger data**: The input that started the workflow
* **Step outputs**: Data returned by each step
* **Error messages**: If the run failed, what went wrong

## Step-by-Step Execution

Each run shows the progression through your workflow:

1. See which steps completed successfully
2. Identify where failures occurred
3. View the data passed between steps
4. Debug issues by examining step inputs and outputs

## Error Handling

When a run fails:

1. Open the failed run
2. Find the step that caused the failure
3. Check the error message for details
4. Common issues:
   * Missing required fields
   * Invalid data format
   * External API errors
   * Permission issues

## Re-running Workflows

If a run fails, you can:

* Fix the underlying issue and wait for the next trigger
* For manual workflows, trigger again with the same or updated data
* Review the workflow logic to prevent future failures

## Performance Tips

### Managing Run History

* Runs are retained for historical reference
* Very old runs may be archived automatically
* Export run data if you need to keep records

### Monitoring Best Practices

* Check runs regularly after activating new workflows
* Review failed runs to identify patterns
