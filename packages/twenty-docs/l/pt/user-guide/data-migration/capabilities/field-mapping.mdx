## How Field Mapping Works

When you upload a file, Twenty analyzes your columns and attempts to match them to existing fields.

### Automatic Mapping

Twenty tries to match columns based on:

* Column header names (exact or similar matches)
* Data type detection (dates, numbers, emails)
* Common field patterns

<Note>**Quick tip:** Export a few rows from the object you want to import. The exported file will have the exact column names Twenty expects, making automatic mapping seamless during import.</Note>

### Manual Mapping Options

For each column, you can:

* **Map to a field**: Select the matching Twenty field from a dropdown
* **Do not map**: Skip the column entirely (data won't be imported)

<Note>**Fields must exist before import.** The import creates records, not fields. Create custom fields under **Settings → Data Model** before importing.</Note>

## Field Type Compatibility

All field types available in the Data Model are supported for import.

You can also import `id` values to either assign a specific ID to new records or update existing ones.

## Data Format Requirements

<Note>**Some fields have special syntax.** We recommend downloading the sample file before preparing your import to see the expected syntax for each field type.</Note>

### Address Fields

Address is a nested field with multiple columns. Some can be left empty.

* **Address / Address 1**: Street address line 1
* **Address / Address 2**: Street address line 2
* **Address / City**: City name
* **Address / State**: State or province
* **Address / Country**: Country name
* **Address / Post Code**: Postal/ZIP code

### Array Fields

Use the following format:

```
["value1","value2"]
```

### Boolean Fields

Use `TRUE` or `FALSE` (uppercase) - not `true` or `false`

### Currency Fields

Currency is a nested field with two columns that **both must be filled**:

* **Amount / Amount**: The numeric value (e.g., `1234.56`)
* **Amount / Currency**: The currency code (e.g., `USD`, `EUR`)

### Date Fields

Supported formats:

* `YYYY-MM-DD` (recommended)
* `MM/DD/YYYY`
* `DD/MM/YYYY`
* ISO 8601 format

### Domain Fields

* It is recommended to use the format `https://domain.com` to avoid creating duplicates, as this is the format used for Companies created by the mailbox and calendar synchronizations
* A `Domain Label` and `Domain URL` can be filled: best practice is to fill `domain.com` in the label and `https://domain.com` in the url
* Domains must be unique within the Companies object
* **Domains must be unique within the file to import**

### Email Fields

* Must be valid email format
* Emails must be unique within the People object
* **Emails must be unique within the file to import**
* For additional emails: use **Emails / Primary Email** for the main email, and **Emails / Additional Emails** with this format:

```
["jane@twenty.com","jane.doe@twenty.com"]
```

### Id Fields

Specifying an `id` during import is optional. Twenty auto-generates one if not provided.

Use cases for mapping an `id` column:

* **Set a specific ID**: Choose the UUID for newly created records
* **Update existing records**: Match against existing records to update them instead of creating duplicates. In that case, it is recommended to not map the other unique fields: mapping only one unique field ensures a smoother import.

<Note>If you provide an `id`, it must be in UUID format (e.g., `c776ee49-f608-4a77-8cc8-6fe96ae1e43f`).</Note>

### JSON Fields

Use valid JSON format:

```
{"key":"value","key2":"value2"}
```

### Links Fields

Similar to Domain fields:

* Fill both the label and URL columns: **Links / Link URL** and **Links / Link Label**
* Use full URL format: `https://example.com`
* For secondary links, use **Links / Secondary Links** column with this format:

```
[{"url":"https://twenty.com","label":"Twenty"}]
```

### Multi-Select Fields

Use the **API names** (not the display labels) in the following format:

```
["VALUE1","VALUE2"]
```

See [here](#finding-api-names-for-select-fields) where to find the API names.

<Note>New select options will not be created automatically by the import. They must be added under **Settings → Data Model** before importing.</Note>

<Warning>
  **Import overwrites, it does not add.**

  If a record already has `VALUE2` and `VALUE3` selected, and you import `["VALUE1"]`, the record will only have `VALUE1` after import. The previous selections are replaced, not merged.
</Warning>

### Number Fields

* Numbers only
* Decimals use period: `1234.56`
* No thousands separators

### Phone Fields

Phone is a nested field with multiple columns that **must be filled**

* **Phones / Primary Phone Number**: The phone number (e.g., `4159095555`)
* **Phones / Primary Phone Country Code**: Country code (e.g., `US`)
* **Phones / Primary Phone Calling Code**: Dialing code (e.g., `+1`)

### Rating Fields

Use the API name format: `RATING_1`, `RATING_2`, `RATING_3`, `RATING_4`, `RATING_5`

### Relation Fields

Please see our dedicated article: [Import Relations Between Objects](/l/pt/user-guide/data-migration/capabilities/import-relations)

### Select Fields

Use the **API name** of the option (not the display label):

```
VALUE1
```

See [here](#finding-api-names-for-select-fields) where to find the API names.
<Note>New select options will not be created automatically by the import. They must be added under **Settings → Data Model** before importing.</Note>

### Text Fields

* No special formatting required
* Leading/trailing spaces are trimmed

## Finding API Names

For Select, Multi-Select, and Array fields with predefined options, you must use the **API names**, not the display labels.

### How to Find API Names

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the object and field
3. Enable **Advanced mode** (toggle at the bottom right of the settings page)
4. View the API name for each option
