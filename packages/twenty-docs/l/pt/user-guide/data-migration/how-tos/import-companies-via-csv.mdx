## Overview

This guide walks you through importing your companies into Twenty. **Companies should be imported first** because People and Opportunities link to Companies.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites Checklist

<Check>
  Your file is CSV, XLSX, or XLS format
</Check>

<Check>
  File has fewer than 10,000 records
</Check>

<Check>
  No duplicate domains in your file
</Check>

<Check>
  All custom fields exist in **Settings → Data Model**
</Check>

<Note>
  Need to import more than 10,000 companies? Split into multiple files or use the [API import](/l/pt/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-data-via-api).
</Note>

## Step 1: Prepare Your Company Data

### Required and Recommended Fields

| Field             | Required?   | Format               | Notes                    |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Name**          | Recommended | Text                 | Company display name     |
| **Domain**        | Recommended | `https://domain.com` | Unique identifier        |
| **Address**       | Optional    | Multiple columns     | See below                |
| **Employees**     | Optional    | Number               | Employee count           |
| **Custom fields** | Optional    | Varies               | Must exist in Data Model |

### Domain Format

<Warning>
  **Use the format `https://domain.com` for domains.**

  This matches the format used when Companies are auto-created from email/calendar sync, preventing duplicates later.
</Warning>

**Domain columns:**

* **Domain / Domain Label**: `acme.com`
* **Domain / Domain URL**: `https://acme.com`

### Address Format

Address is a nested field with multiple columns:

```
Address / Address 1,Address / City,Address / State,Address / Country,Address / Post Code
123 Main Street,San Francisco,CA,USA,94105
```

### Sample CSV Structure

```csv
name,Domain / Domain URL,Domain / Domain Label,Address / City,Address / Country,employees
Acme Corp,https://acme.com,acme.com,San Francisco,USA,250
Widget Co,https://widgets.co,widgets.co,New York,USA,50
```

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Click **Download sample file** during import to see the exact column names Twenty expects.
</Note>

## Step 2: Access the Import Feature

**Option 1: From the Companies View**

1. Navigate to **Companies** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **⋮** icon on the top right
3. Select **Import records**

**Option 2: Using Command Menu**

1. Press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows)
2. Type "import"
3. Select **Import records**
4. Choose **Companies**

## Step 3: Upload Your File

1. Click **Select file**
2. Choose your CSV, XLSX, or XLS file
3. Wait for Twenty to analyze your file

## Step 4: Map Your Columns

Twenty automatically tries to match your columns to fields. Review and adjust:

1. **Check automatic mappings** — verify they're correct
2. **Fix incorrect mappings** — click the dropdown to select the right field
3. **Skip columns** — select **Do not map** for columns you don't want to import

### Important Mapping Rules

* **Domain**: Map to **Domain / Domain URL** (not Domain Label)
* **Address**: Map each part to its specific column (City, State, etc.)
* **Select fields**: Values must match existing options (or you'll map them in the next step)

## Step 5: Map Select Field Values

If you have Select or Multi-Select fields:

1. Twenty shows your values alongside existing options
2. Match each value in your file to a Twenty option
3. Or create new options if needed

<Note>
  Select options use **API names**, not display labels. Check **Settings → Data Model** → Enable **Advanced mode** to see API names.
</Note>

## Step 6: Review and Fix Errors

Before completing the import, Twenty validates your data:

1. Click **Next Steps**
2. Rows with errors are highlighted in **yellow**
3. **Fix errors directly** — click a cell and edit the value
4. **Remove problematic rows** — click the X to skip that row

### Common Company Import Errors

| Error                      | Cause                           | Solution                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Duplicate domain**       | Domain already exists in Twenty | Remove from file or update existing record |
| **Invalid domain format**  | Wrong format                    | Use `https://domain.com`                   |
| **Missing required field** | Required field is empty         | Fill in the value or remove the row        |

## Step 7: Complete the Import

1. Review the import summary
2. Click **Confirm** to import
3. Wait for the import to complete
4. Verify by checking a few records

## After Importing Companies

Now you can import records that link to Companies:

1. **[Import People](/l/pt/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-contacts-via-csv)** — link them to Companies using the domain
2. **Import Opportunities** — link them to Companies
3. **Verify the import** — spot-check a few records to ensure data is correct

## Updating Existing Companies

To update companies instead of creating new ones:

1. Include the `domain` or `id` column in your file
2. Twenty matches records by this unique identifier
3. Existing companies are updated; new ones are created

See [How to Update Existing Records](/l/pt/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/update-existing-records-via-import) for details.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't two Companies have the same domain?">
    Domain is a unique identifier in Twenty. This prevents duplicate companies and ensures email sync correctly links emails to the right company.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I have companies without a domain?">
    You can leave the domain empty. However, we recommend adding domains when possible for better data quality and automatic email linking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import companies without any People linked?">
    Yes! You can import companies first, then import People later and link them using the company domain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I import a domain that already exists?">
    If you include a unique identifier (domain or id) that matches an existing company, Twenty updates that company instead of creating a duplicate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I fix 'duplicate domain' errors?">
    Either remove the duplicate from your file, or include the company's `id` to update the existing record instead.
  </Accordion>
