title: Migrating from Self-Hosted to Cloud
description: Step-by-step guide to migrate your Twenty self-hosted instance to Twenty Cloud.
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through migrating your data from a Twenty self-hosted instance to Twenty Cloud. The process involves setting up your cloud workspace, exporting your data, and re-importing it.

<Note>Views, workflows, and roles must be recreated manually after migration. Plan time for this configuration work.</Note>

## Step 1: Create Your Cloud Workspace

1. Go to [app.twenty.com](https://app.twenty.com) and create a new workspace
2. Complete the initial setup wizard
3. Note your new workspace URL

## Step 2: Recreate Your Data Model

Before importing data, recreate your custom objects and fields:

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model** in your cloud instance
2. Create custom objects that match your self-hosted setup
3. Add custom fields to standard and custom objects
4. Configure field settings (unique, required, etc.)

<Note>Take screenshots of your self-hosted data model for reference, or keep both instances open side by side.</Note>

## Step 3: Invite All Users

<Warning>
  **Critical: Invite users BEFORE importing data.**

  Users must accept their invitations before you import any records that reference them (like Account Owner fields). If users don't exist yet, those relations cannot be mapped.
</Warning>

1. Go to **Settings → Members** in your cloud instance
2. Invite all team members who had accounts on self-hosted
3. **Wait for everyone to accept** their invitation
4. Verify all users appear in your Members list

## Step 4: Export Data from Self-Hosted

Export each object from your self-hosted instance:

1. Navigate to each object (Companies, People, Opportunities, etc.)
2. Configure the view to show **all columns** you want to migrate
3. Click **⋮ → Export view**
4. Save each CSV file with a clear name (e.g., `companies-export.csv`)

**Export in this order** (for reference when importing):

1. Companies
2. People
3. Opportunities
4. Custom objects (following their dependencies)
5. Tasks, Notes

## Step 5: Update Workspace Member References

The exported CSVs contain user IDs from your self-hosted instance. These IDs won't match your cloud instance, so you need to replace them with emails.

**For each CSV file with user references (Owner, Assignee, etc.):**

1. Open the CSV in a spreadsheet application
2. Add a new column next to each user ID column (e.g., `accountOwnerEmail` next to `accountOwnerId`)
3. Fill in the **email address** of each user
4. You can delete the old ID column or leave it (it will be skipped during import)

**Example:**

Before:

```csv
name,domain,accountOwnerId
Acme Corp,https://acme.com,old-uuid-123
```

After:

```csv
name,domain,accountOwnerEmail
Acme Corp,https://acme.com,john@yourcompany.com
```

<Note>Use the same email addresses that users used to accept their cloud workspace invitation.</Note>

## Step 6: Plan Your Import Order

Import files in the correct order to maintain relationships:

1. **Companies** first (no dependencies)
2. **People** second (link to Companies)
3. **Opportunities** third (link to Companies and People)
4. **Custom objects** (following their dependencies)
5. **Tasks and Notes** last (link to other records)

See [How to Import Relations](/l/pt/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/import-relations-between-objects-via-csv) for details on maintaining relationships.

## Step 7: Import to Cloud

For each CSV file, in order:

1. Navigate to the object in your cloud instance
2. Click **⋮ → Import records**
3. Upload the CSV file
4. Map columns to fields:
   * Map user email columns to the appropriate relation fields
   * Map other columns as usual
5. Review and fix any errors
6. Confirm the import
7. Verify a few records before proceeding to the next file

## Step 8: Recreate Configuration

After importing data, manually recreate:

### Views

* Recreate saved views with filters, sorts, and column configurations
* Set up any kanban or calendar views

### Workflows

* Recreate automations in **Settings → Workflows**
* Test each workflow before relying on it

### Roles and Permissions

* Configure roles in **Settings → Roles**
* Assign users to appropriate roles

### Integrations

* Reconnect email and calendar sync for each user
* Reconfigure any API integrations with new API keys

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I migrate workflows automatically?">
    Not currently. Workflows must be recreated manually in your cloud instance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about file attachments and images?">
    File attachments are not included in CSV exports. You'll need to re-upload any attachments manually, migrate them via API or contact our team for assistance with large migrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I keep both instances running during migration?">
    Yes, we recommend keeping your self-hosted instance running until you've verified the cloud migration is complete. Just be careful not to create new data in both places.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a user hasn't accepted their invitation yet?">
    Records referencing that user will fail to import or the relation will be empty. Ensure all users accept invitations before importing data.
