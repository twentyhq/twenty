## Step 1: Prepare Your Contact Data

### Required and Recommended Fields

| Field             | Required?   | Format            | Notes                     |

| **First Name**    | Recommended | Text              |                           |
| **Last Name**     | Recommended | Text              |                           |
| **Company**       | Optional    | Domain or ID      | Links to existing Company |
| **Phone**         | Optional    | Multiple columns  | See below                 |
| **Job Title**     | Optional    | Text              |                           |
| **Custom fields** | Optional    | Varies            | Must exist in Data Model  |

### Email Format

* Must be valid email format: `name@domain.com`
* **Must be unique** — no duplicates in your file or in Twenty
* For additional emails, use the **Emails / Additional Emails** column:

```
["jane@twenty.com","jane.doe@twenty.com"]
```

### Phone Format

Phone is a **nested field** requiring multiple columns:

| Column                                  | Example      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Phones / Primary Phone Number**       | `4159095555` |
| **Phones / Primary Phone Country Code** | `US`         |
| **Phones / Primary Phone Calling Code** | `+1`         |

### Linking to Companies

Add a column with the Company's unique identifier:

| Column Name     | Format     | Example                                |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `companyDomain` | URL format | `https://acme.com`                     |
| `companyId`     | UUID       | `c776ee49-f608-4a77-8cc8-6fe96ae1e43f` |

<Note>
  **Use Domain URL format** (`https://acme.com`), not the label. This matches how Companies are stored in Twenty.
</Note>

### Sample CSV Structure

```csv
firstName,lastName,email,jobTitle,companyDomain,Phones / Primary Phone Number,Phones / Primary Phone Country Code
John,Smith,john@acme.com,CEO,https://acme.com,4159095555,US
Jane,Doe,jane@widgets.co,CTO,https://widgets.co,2125551234,US
```

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Click **Download sample file** during import or export a few existing People to see the exact column names Twenty expects.
</Note>

## Step 2: Access the Import Feature

**Option 1: From the People View**

1. Navigate to **People** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **⋮** icon on the top right
3. Select **Import records**

**Option 2: Using Command Menu**

1. Press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows)
2. Type "import"
3. Select **Import records**
4. Choose **People**

## Step 3: Upload Your File

1. Click **Select file**
2. Choose your CSV, XLSX, or XLS file
3. Wait for Twenty to analyze your file

## Step 4: Map Your Columns

Twenty automatically tries to match your columns to fields. Review and adjust:

1. **Check automatic mappings** — verify they're correct
2. **Fix incorrect mappings** — click the dropdown to select the right field
3. **Skip columns** — select **Do not map** for columns you don't want to import

### Important Mapping Rules

| Column Type       | Map To                         | Notes                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Company reference | **Company** relation field     | Use domain OR id, not both         |
| Email             | **Email**                      | Primary email address              |
| Additional emails | **Emails / Additional Emails** | Array format                       |
| Phone             | Separate columns               | Number, Country Code, Calling Code |

<img src="/images/user-guide/import-export-data/match-columns.png" style={{width:'100%'}} />

### Mapping the Company Relation

When mapping the company column:

1. Find your company reference column (e.g., `companyDomain`)
2. Map it to the **Company** relation field
3. Twenty will link each Person to the matching Company

<Warning>
  **Map only ONE unique identifier for relations.**

  Don't map both `companyId` AND `companyDomain`. Choose one—preferably domain since it's human-readable.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Map Select Field Values

If you have Select or Multi-Select fields (like Lead Source):

1. Twenty shows your values alongside existing options
2. Match each value in your file to a Twenty option
3. Or create new options if needed

<Note>
  Select options use **API names**, not display labels. Check **Settings → Data Model** → Enable **Advanced mode** to see API names.
</Note>

## Step 6: Review and Fix Errors

Before completing the import, Twenty validates your data:

1. Click **Next Steps**
2. Rows with errors are highlighted in **yellow**
3. **Fix errors directly** — click a cell and edit the value
4. **Remove problematic rows** — click the X to skip that row

### Common Contact Import Errors

| Error                      | Cause                                  | Solution                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Duplicate email**        | Email already exists in Twenty or file | Remove duplicate or update existing record  |
| **Invalid email format**   | Email format incorrect                 | Fix to `name@domain.com`                    |
| **Relation not found**     | Company doesn't exist                  | Import Companies first or fix the reference |
| **Missing required field** | Required field is empty                | Fill in the value or remove the row         |

## Step 7: Complete the Import

1. Review the import summary
2. Click **Confirm** to import
3. Wait for the import to complete
4. Verify by checking a few records and their Company links

## After Importing Contacts

Your contacts are now in Twenty! Next steps:

1. **Verify Company links** — open a few People records to confirm they're linked to the right Company
2. **Import Opportunities** — if needed, link them to People and Companies
3. **Set up email sync** — connect your mailbox to see email history on contact records

## Updating Existing Contacts

To update contacts instead of creating new ones:

1. Include the `email` or `id` column in your file
2. Twenty matches records by this unique identifier
3. Existing contacts are updated; new ones are created

See [How to Update Existing Records](/l/pt/user-guide/data-migration/how-tos/update-existing-records-via-import) for details.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't two People have the same email?">
    Email is a unique identifier in Twenty. This prevents duplicate contacts and ensures email sync correctly links emails to the right person.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I have people without an email?">
    You can leave the email empty. However, we recommend adding emails when possible for better data quality and email sync functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I link People to Companies during import?">
    Add a column with the Company's domain (e.g., `https://acme.com`) or ID. During mapping, connect this column to the Company relation field.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the Company doesn't exist yet?">
    Import Companies first, then import People. The Company must exist before you can reference it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import the ID from my previous CRM?">
    Yes! Create a custom field marked as "unique" in your data model to store the external ID. Note: the field name `id` is reserved for Twenty's internal ID.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I fix 'relation not found' errors?">
    The Company you're referencing doesn't exist. Either import the Company first, or check that the domain/ID exactly matches an existing Company.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
