Custom objects let you store information unique to your business that standard objects don't cover. For example: Projects, Products, Tickets, or Listings.

<Note>
  **Not sure if you need an object or a field?** See [Understanding Your Data Model](/l/pt/user-guide/data-model/overview) for guidance.
</Note>

## Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Click **+ New object**
3. Fill in:
   * **Singular name** (e.g., "Listing")
   * **Plural name** (e.g., "Listings")
   * **Icon**
   * **Description** (optional)
4. Click **Save**

Your object appears in the sidebar immediately.

## Next: Add Fields

New objects start with basic fields. Add custom fields to capture the data you need:

1. In **Settings → Data Model**, select your object
2. Click **+ Add Field**
3. Choose a field type, configure, and save

See [How to Create Custom Fields](/l/pt/user-guide/data-model/how-tos/create-custom-fields) for details on field types and configuration.

## Connecting to Other Objects

To link your object to People, Companies, or other objects, create a relation field. See [How to Create Relation Fields](/l/pt/user-guide/data-model/how-tos/create-relation-fields).

## Deactivating an Object

If you no longer need an object:

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Toggle the object off

The object is hidden but data is preserved. You can reactivate or permanently delete later.
