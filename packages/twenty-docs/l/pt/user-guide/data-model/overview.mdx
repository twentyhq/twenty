## What is a Data Model?

A data model is the structure that defines how information is organized in your CRM. Think of it as the **blueprint** of your customer data — you design it once, then fill it with your actual data.

## Key Concepts

### Objects

**Objects** are the main categories of data in your CRM. Each object represents a type of thing you want to track.

Twenty comes with standard objects:

* **People** — individuals (contacts, leads, partners)
* **Companies** — organizations
* **Opportunities** — deals or sales
* **Notes** — attached notes on records
* **Tasks** — to-dos linked to records

You can also create **custom objects** for anything specific to your business (e.g., Projects, Subscriptions, Events).

### Fields

**Fields** are the properties or attributes that describe each object. They store the actual information.

For example, the **People** object has fields like:

* Name
* Email
* Phone
* Job Title
* Company (a relation to the Companies object)

Fields have different **types**: text, number, date, select, multi-select, relation, and more. You can add custom fields to any object.

### Records

**Records** are the individual entries within an object — the actual data you create and manage.

For example:

* "John Smith" is a **record** in the People object
* "Acme Corp" is a **record** in the Companies object

**An analogy:**

| Data Model Concept | Real-World Analogy                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Objects**        | Sections in a book (the categories)        |
| **Fields**         | Columns in a spreadsheet (the properties)  |
| **Records**        | Rows in a spreadsheet (the actual entries) |

You design the data model (objects + fields) once, then create many records within that structure.

## Why Customize Your Data Model?

Every business works differently. Customizing your data model means you can shape Twenty around **your** processes instead of forcing yours into a rigid system.

Twenty offers full flexibility:

* Create as many custom objects as you need
* Add unlimited custom fields
* The price doesn't change based on customization

## Tips to Design Your Data Model

### 1. Start with Your Core Objects

Identify the main concepts you work with. Twenty already provides:

* **People** — your contacts
* **Companies** — your accounts
* **Opportunities** — your deals

Think about what else you might need:

* Stripe would need a `Subscriptions` object
* Airbnb would need a `Trips` object
* An accelerator would need a `Batches` object

### 2. Use Fields for Variations, Not New Objects

If something is just a characteristic of an existing object, make it a **field**.

**Use fields for:**

* Categories and labels (e.g., `Industry` for Companies)
* Status values (e.g., `Stage` for Opportunities)
* Attributes and properties

### 3. Create an Object When It Stands on Its Own

If the concept has its own lifecycle, properties, or relationships, it deserves an object.

**Create an object for:**

* **Projects** — have deadlines, owners, and tasks
* **Subscriptions** — connect companies, products, and invoices
* **Events** — involve attendees and follow-up actions

These go beyond a single field because they carry their own data and relationships.

### 4. Create an Object When Records Are Open-Ended

If something can be linked multiple times and you don't know how many, use an object.

**Bad approach:**
Creating fields like `Product 1`, `Product 2`, `Product 3`...

**Good approach:**
Create a `Products` object and relate it to records. This supports one, two, or a hundred products without changing your model.

### 5. Keep It Simple First

Start with fields. Move to new objects only when you feel the limits:

* Too many fields on one object
* Repeated records that should be separate
* Relationships that don't fit neatly

## Special Note on People, Companies, and Opportunities

<Warning>
  **Email and calendar sync only works with People, Companies, and Opportunities.**

  These are the only objects where you can access synchronized emails and meetings from your mailbox/calendar. We recommend using them as much as possible.
</Warning>

**Best practices:**

* If you need categories of People, use fields (not new objects)
* Example: Use a `Person Type` field with values "Prospect" and "Partner" instead of creating separate objects
* Create different **views** to filter: one showing partners, another showing prospects

**It's okay to have fields that don't apply to every record.** For example, a `Referral Link` field on People that only applies when `Person Type = Partner`. Hide this field from views where it's not relevant.

## Questions to Guide Your Choice

Ask yourself:

<Check>Is this just a property of something I already have, or does it need its own properties?</Check>
<Check>Will I ever need to track multiple of these per record, without knowing how many?</Check>
<Check>Does this concept connect to several different objects, not just one?</Check>
<Check>Will it have its own lifecycle (stages, start/end dates)?</Check>

If the answer is "yes" to one or more, it's probably time for a new object.

## Accessing Your Data Model

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Data Model**
3. View all your objects (standard and custom)
4. Click any object to see and edit its fields

<Note>
  **Don't see Data Model in Settings?**

  Access to the data model is usually restricted to administrators. Contact your workspace admin if you need access.
