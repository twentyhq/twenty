## Prerequisites

Your Tasks object needs a **Due Date** field (Date or Date & Time type).

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Tasks**
2. Click the view dropdown → **+ Add view**
3. Name your view (e.g., "Tasks Calendar")
4. Click **Create**
5. Click **Options** and select **Calendar** as the layout
6. Choose **Due Date** as the date field
7. Click **Save**

## Configure Your Calendar

### Display Fields on Events

1. Click **Options → Fields**
2. Click the **eye icon** to show/hide fields
3. Drag to reorder

Recommended fields to display:

* **Title** — task name
* **Assignee** — who's responsible
* **Status** — current progress

### Filter Your Calendar

Create focused views:

* **My Tasks**: Filter by Assignee = Me
* **This Week**: Filter by Due Date = This week
* **Overdue**: Filter by Due Date < Today, Status ≠ Done

## Other Calendar Use Cases

| Object        | Date Field | Purpose                   |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Opportunities | Close Date | Track expected closes     |
| Custom Events | Event Date | Plan activities           |
| Projects      | Deadline   | Monitor project timelines |

## Tips

* **Review weekly**: Start each week by checking your calendar view
* **Combine with table view**: Use calendar for overview, table for details
* **Set visibility**: Keep personal task calendars as Unlisted
