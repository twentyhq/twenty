Automatically send emails when specific events occur in your CRM—welcome new contacts, follow up on opportunities, or notify team members.

## Prerequisites

Before you can send emails from workflows:

1. Connect an email account under **Settings → Accounts**
2. Ensure the account has sending permissions enabled

## Basic Email Workflow

### Example: Welcome Email for New Contacts

**Goal**: Send a welcome email when a new person is added to the CRM.

**Setup**:

1. **Create workflow**: Go to **Settings → Workflows** and click **+ New Workflow**

2. **Add trigger**: Select **Record is Created** → **People**

3. **Add Send Email action**:
   * Click **+** to add an action
   * Select **Send Email**
   * Configure the email:

| Field       | Value                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **To**      | `{{trigger.object.email}}`             |
| **Subject** | `Welcome to {{Your Company Name}}`     |
| **Body**    | `Hi {{trigger.object.firstName}}, ...` |

4. **Test and activate**: Test with a sample record, then activate

## Using Variables in Emails

Reference data from previous steps using `{{variable}}` syntax:

```text
Hi {{trigger.object.firstName}},

Thank you for connecting with us!

Your company, {{trigger.object.company.name}}, is now in our system.

Best regards,
The Team
```

### Available Variables from Triggers

| Trigger Type               | Common Variables                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Record Created/Updated** | `{{trigger.object.fieldName}}`         |
| **Manual**                 | `{{trigger.selectedRecord.fieldName}}` |
| **Webhook**                | `{{trigger.body.fieldName}}`           |

## Advanced: Conditional Emails

### Example: Different Emails Based on Lead Source

**Goal**: Send different welcome emails based on where the lead came from.

**Setup**:

1. **Trigger**: Record is Created (People)

2. **Add Filter action**:
   * Condition: `{{trigger.object.source}}` equals `"Website"`
   * If true → continue to website welcome email

3. **Branch for other sources**:
   * Create parallel branches for different sources
   * Each branch has its own Send Email action

## Sending Emails to Multiple Recipients

### Example: Notify Team When Deal Closes

**Goal**: Email the sales rep and their manager when an opportunity is won.

**Setup**:

1. **Trigger**: Record is Updated (Opportunities, Stage = "Closed Won")

2. **Search Records**: Find the opportunity owner's manager

3. **Send Email #1**: To opportunity owner
   * To: `{{trigger.object.owner.email}}`
   * Subject: `Congratulations on closing {{trigger.object.name}}!`

4. **Send Email #2**: To manager
   * To: `{{searchRecords.manager.email}}`
   * Subject: `Deal Won: {{trigger.object.name}}`

## Scheduled Follow-up Emails

### Example: Follow Up 3 Days After Meeting

**Goal**: Send a follow-up email 3 days after a meeting is logged.

**Setup**:

1. **Trigger**: Record is Created (Activities, Type = "Meeting")

2. **Delay action**: Wait 3 days

3. **Send Email**:
   * To: Meeting attendee
   * Subject: Following up on our conversation
   * Body: Reference meeting details from trigger

## Best Practices

### Email Content

* Keep subject lines concise and relevant
* Personalize with recipient's name
* Include a clear call to action
* Test emails before activating

### Deliverability

* Don't send too many emails too quickly
* Use professional email signatures
* Avoid spam trigger words
* Ensure unsubscribe options for marketing emails

### Troubleshooting

* Verify email account is connected and active
* Check recipient email address is valid
* Review workflow runs for error messages
* Test with your own email address first
