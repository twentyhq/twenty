title: Can I Send Emails from Twenty?
description: Information about sending emails directly from Twenty.

## Current Status

Twenty's email integration is designed to **sync and display** your email history. Emails cannot be composed or sent directly from Twenty's interface.

When you view an email thread on a record page and click **Reply**, you'll be redirected to the original thread in your mailbox (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). This is where you compose and send your reply.

## What You Can Do Today

* **View email history** on People, Companies, and Opportunities records
* **Read full email threads** with contacts in your CRM
* **Track communication context** alongside calendar events
* **Auto-create contacts** from email interactions
* **Reply via redirect** — click Reply to jump to your mailbox

## Sending Emails via Workflows

While you can't send emails manually from Twenty, you **can send emails automatically using Workflows**. This is useful for:

* Automated follow-ups
* Notifications to contacts
* Triggered communications based on record changes

Emails sent via workflows go through your connected mailbox account.

## Email Sequences and Newsletters

For email sequences and newsletters, we recommend using workflows to connect Twenty to a dedicated email marketing tool.

<Warning>
  Mass emails should not be sent directly from your mailbox to protect your domain reputation. Use a dedicated tool for bulk communications.
</Warning>

→ See [How to send emails from workflows](/l/pt/user-guide/workflows/capabilities/send-emails-from-workflows) for setup instructions

## Future Plans

Native email composition from within Twenty is on our roadmap. Join our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/discussions) to share your use case and help prioritize this feature.
