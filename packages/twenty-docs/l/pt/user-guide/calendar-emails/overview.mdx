</Warning>

## Email Configuration

### Message Visibility

Choose different levels of visibility for your emails:

* **Metadata Only**: Share only basic information (sender, recipient, date, time)
* **Subject and Metadata**: Share subject line along with metadata
* **All Email Content**: Share entire email content including attachments

### Contact Auto-Creation

* **Deactivated**: No automatic contact creation
* **For messages sent & received**: Create contacts for all external email interactions
* **For messages sent only**: Create contacts only for emails you send
* **Note**: Internal emails (same domain) are never synced to maintain privacy

<Note>When enabled, contacts are automatically linked to their Company records based on their email domain. If the company doesn't exist yet, Twenty creates it for you.</Note>

### Control which emails get sync with Message Folder Selection (Lab Feature)

Control which email folders sync with Twenty:

1. Go to **Settings → Releases → Lab** and enable **Message Folder**
2. Return to **Settings → Accounts** and select your connected email account
3. Choose which folders to sync:
   * **Inbox**: Primary incoming emails
   * **Sent**: Outgoing emails you've sent
   * **Custom Folders**: Any specific folders you want to include
   * **Exclude Folders**: Skip folders like Spam, Trash, or personal folders

This gives you precise control over which emails appear in your CRM without syncing everything.

**What Gets Synced:**

* **External Emails**: All emails with external contacts from selected folders
* **Internal Emails**: Not synced (same domain emails remain private)
* **Attachments**: Coming in H1 2026

**Note**: We don't provide a CC email address for selective syncing. Instead, use the Message Folder feature above to achieve the same level of control over which emails sync with Twenty.

## Calendar Configuration

### Event Visibility

Choose what will be visible to other users in your workspace:

* **Everything**: The whole event details will be shared with your team
* **Metadata**: Only date & participants will be shared with your team

### Contact Auto-Creation for Meetings

* **Yes**: Automatically create contacts for meeting participants not in your CRM
* **No**: Only link meetings to existing contacts

<Note>When enabled, contacts are automatically linked to their Company records based on their email domain. If the company doesn't exist yet, Twenty creates it for you.</Note>

### Control which events get sync

* **Meeting Import**: Automatically import calendar events
* **Contact Linking**: Link meetings to People and Company records

**What Gets Synced:**

* **Meetings**: Calendar events with external participants
* **Contact Linking**: Events automatically linked to CRM records
* **Team Events**: Shared calendar visibility

## Sync Frequency

**Updates every 5 minutes**: Both email and calendar data sync automatically every 5 minutes after the initial import.

<Note>
  **Initial sync timing**: Calendar sync completes quickly (usually within minutes), while email sync takes longer for large mailboxes—up to a few hours depending on volume. Don't worry if you see contacts from calendar events appearing before your email contacts; this is normal behavior.
