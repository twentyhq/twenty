## Types of Relations

### One-to-Many

One record in Object A can be linked to many records in Object B.

**Example:** One Company can have many People (employees).

### Many-to-One

Many records in Object A can be linked to one record in Object B.

**Example:** Many People can belong to one Company.

### Relations to Multiple Object Types

Some objects can link to multiple object types on one side of the relation.

**Example:** A Note can be attached to one Person AND one Company AND one Opportunity simultaneously. The Note is on the "many" side, connecting to multiple "one" sides.

Similarly, a Project (on the "one" side) could receive links from multiple People, multiple Companies, and multiple Notes.

<Warning>
  **Import/Export limitation**: Relations pointing to multiple object types are not yet supported for CSV import/export. This is on our roadmap.
</Warning>

### Many-to-Many

Many records in Object A can be linked to many records in Object B.

**Example:** Many People can be linked to many Projects, and vice versa.

<Warning>
  **Many-to-Many is not yet supported.**

  This relation type is planned for H1 2026. As a workaround, create an intermediate "junction" object (e.g., "Project Assignments") that has Many-to-One relations to both objects.
</Warning>

## Creating a Relation Field

1. Go to **Settings → Data Model**
2. Select the object where you want to add the relation
3. Click **+ Add Field**
4. Select **Relation** as the field type
5. Choose the target object(s) to relate to
6. Configure the relation settings:
   * **Field name on source object**: The name of the relation field on the object you're editing
   * **Field name on destination object**: The name of the relation field that will appear on the target object
   * Relation type (one-to-many, many-to-one)
7. Нажмите **Сохранить**

## Standard Relations

Twenty comes with pre-built relations between standard objects:

| From Object | To Object | Relation Type |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Люди        | Компании  | Many-to-One   |
| Возможности | Компании  | Many-to-One   |
| Возможности | Люди      | Many-to-One   |

## Лучшие практики

### Planning Relations

* **Map your data model**: Plan relations before creating them
* **Consider direction**: Think about which object "owns" the relationship
* **Avoid circular dependencies**: Keep your data model clean

### Naming Relations

* **Use clear names**: Make it obvious what the relation represents
* **Be consistent**: Use similar naming patterns across relations
* **Consider both sides**: Name both sides of the relation appropriately

### Performance

* **Don't over-relate**: Too many relations can slow down your workspace

## Limitations

* **Deleting relations** removes the link but not the related records
* **Circular relations** should be avoided for data integrity
