Fiecare vizualizare (cu excepția vizualizărilor implicite "Toate [Numele obiectului]") are propria setare de vizibilitate.

## Steps

1. Open the view you want to restrict
2. Click **Options** in the top right
3. Click **Visibility**
4. Select **Unlisted**

Your view is now visible only to you.

## Visibility Options

| Setting       | Who Can See           |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| **Workspace** | All workspace members |
| **Unlisted**  | Only you              |

## Notițe

* The default "All [Object Name]" views cannot be made unlisted
* Unlisted views don't appear in other users' view dropdowns
* You can change visibility back to Workspace at any time
