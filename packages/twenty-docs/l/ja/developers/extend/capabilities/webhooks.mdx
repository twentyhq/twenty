Webhooks push data to your systems in real-time when events occur in Twenty — no polling required. Use them to keep external systems in sync, trigger automations, or send alerts.

## Create a Webhook

1. Go to **Settings → APIs & Webhooks → Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Create webhook**
3. Enter your webhook URL (must be publicly accessible)
4. Click **Save**

The webhook activates immediately and starts sending notifications.

### Manage Webhooks

**Edit**: Click the webhook → Update URL → **Save**

**Delete**: Click the webhook → **Delete** → Confirm

## Events

Twenty sends webhooks for these event types:

| Event              | Example                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Record Created** | `person.created`, `company.created`, `note.created`        |
| **Record Updated** | `person.updated`, `company.updated`, `opportunity.updated` |
| **Record Deleted** | `person.deleted`, `company.deleted`                        |

All event types are sent to your webhook URL. Event filtering may be added in future releases.

## Payload Format

Each webhook sends an HTTP POST with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "event": "person.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "abc12345",
    "firstName": "Alice",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "createdAt": "2025-02-10T15:30:45Z",
    "createdBy": "user_123"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-02-10T15:30:50Z"
}
```

| Field       | Description                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `event`     | What happened (e.g., `person.created`)           |
| `data`      | The full record that was created/updated/deleted |
| `timestamp` | When the event occurred (UTC)                    |

<Note>
  Respond with a **2xx HTTP status** (200-299) to acknowledge receipt. Non-2xx responses are logged as delivery failures.
</Note>

## Webhook Validation

Twenty signs each webhook request for security. Validate signatures to ensure requests are authentic.

### Headers

| Header                       | Description           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `X-Twenty-Webhook-Signature` | HMAC SHA256 signature |
| `X-Twenty-Webhook-Timestamp` | Request timestamp     |

### Validation Steps

1. Get the timestamp from `X-Twenty-Webhook-Timestamp`
2. Create the string: `{timestamp}:{JSON payload}`
3. Compute HMAC SHA256 using your webhook secret
4. Compare with `X-Twenty-Webhook-Signature`

### Example (Node.js)

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

const timestamp = req.headers["x-twenty-webhook-timestamp"];
const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
const secret = "your-webhook-secret";

const stringToSign = `${timestamp}:${payload}`;
const expectedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", secret)
  .update(stringToSign)
  .digest("hex");

const isValid = expectedSignature === req.headers["x-twenty-webhook-signature"];
```

## Webhooks vs Workflows

| Method                       | Direction | Use Case                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Webhooks**                 | OUT       | Automatically notify external systems of any record change |
| **Workflow + HTTP Request**  | OUT       | Send data out with custom logic (filters, transformations) |
| **Workflow Webhook Trigger** | IN        | Receive data into Twenty from external systems             |
