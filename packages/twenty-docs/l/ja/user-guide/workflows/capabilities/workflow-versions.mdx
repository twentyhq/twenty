## About Versions

Every time you activate a workflow, a new version is created. This allows you to track changes over time and revert to previous configurations if needed.

## Version Statuses

| Status          | Description                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**       | Being edited, not yet published        |
| **Active**      | Live version responding to triggers    |
| **Deactivated** | Previously active but manually stopped |
| **Archived**    | Past versions kept for history         |

## Working with Drafts

When you edit an active workflow, your changes are saved as a **draft**. The active version continues to run while you work on updates.

Once you're done editing, you can:

* **Activate**: Publish the draft as the new active version (the previous version is archived)
* **Discard**: Delete the draft and keep the current active version

## Version History

### Viewing Past Versions

1. Open the workflow
2. Click the **Versions** tab
3. See all previous versions with timestamps

### Restoring a Version

1. Find the version you want to restore
2. Click **Use as draft**
3. The version is copied to a new draft
4. Make any necessary updates
5. Activate when ready

## Best Practices

### Version Management

* Activate only when ready for production
* Keep meaningful changes between versions
* Document major changes in workflow names or descriptions
* Test in draft mode before activating

### Reverting Changes

* If a new version causes issues, restore the previous version
* Use the version history to track what changed
* Always test restored versions before activating

## Common Workflows

### Quick Edit

1. Make minor changes to an active workflow
2. Test in draft mode
3. Activate the new version

### Major Revision

1. Use the previous version as a starting point
2. Make significant changes in draft
3. Thoroughly test all scenarios
4. Activate when confident

### Rollback

1. Identify the issue with the current version
2. Find the last working version in history
3. Click **Use as draft**
4. Activate to restore the old behavior
