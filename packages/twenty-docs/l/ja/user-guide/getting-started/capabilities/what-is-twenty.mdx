## Vision

Creating a good CRM is hard because it's a balancing act.
For each business, the requirements seem straightforward, yet everyone's needs are distinct.
The result is a CRM that's either too basic, or one that's attempting to be a jack-of-all-trades but ending up as a master of none.

At first, Twenty looks like most CRMs you already know: you can track deals, organize contacts, manage tasks and notes.
**But what sets it apart is our approach to extensibility. We are building an open platform that provides the building blocks for you to solve your unique business problems.**

We prioritize universal principles and common patterns over feature lists.
We don't try to have all the answers and instead empower users to find what works best for them.
Open-source is the bedrock of our approach, ensuring that Twenty evolves with its community, for its community.
