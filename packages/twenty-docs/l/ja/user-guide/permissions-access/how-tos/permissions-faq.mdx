## Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between object and field permissions?">
    * **Object permissions**: Control access to entire records (e.g., can see/edit/delete People records)
    * **Field permissions**: Control access to specific fields within an object (e.g., can see but not edit the Salary field)

    Field permissions allow more granular control over sensitive data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do permission overrides work?">
    Permissions cascade from global to specific:

    1. **All Objects** sets the baseline for all objects
    2. **Object-Level Permissions** can override the global setting for specific objects
    3. **Field-Level Permissions** can override the object setting for specific fields

    More specific settings always take precedence.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do the different permission levels mean?">
    For objects:

    * **See Records**: View records in lists and detail pages
    * **Edit Records**: Modify existing records
    * **Delete Records**: Soft-delete records (can be restored)
    * **Destroy Records**: Permanently delete records

    For fields:

    * **See Field**: View the field value
    * **Edit Field**: Modify the field value
    * **No Access**: Field is completely hidden
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I restrict access to specific records (row-level permissions)?">
    Row-level permissions will be available on the **Organization** plan by Q1 2026. This allows you to restrict access to specific records based on criteria (e.g., only see your own opportunities).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I make a field read-only for certain users?">
    1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
    2. Select the role
    3. Navigate to the object containing the field
    4. Set the field permission to **See Field** (without Edit Field)
