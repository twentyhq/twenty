description: Troubleshooting missing emails on records.

## Common Reasons

### 1. Initial Sync Still in Progress

Email sync takes time, especially for large mailboxes.

* **Calendar sync**: Completes in minutes
* **Email sync**: Can take several hours for large mailboxes

**Solution**: Wait up to a few hours for the initial import to complete.

### 2. Contact Doesn't Exist in Twenty

Emails only appear on existing People records. If the contact wasn't created yet:

* Enable **Contact Auto-Creation** in your mailbox settings
* Or manually create the Person record first

**Solution**: Go to **Settings → Accounts**, select your mailbox, and enable contact auto-creation.

### 3. Internal Emails Are Excluded

Emails between colleagues (same email domain) are never synced to maintain privacy.

**Solution**: This is expected behavior. Only external emails are synced.

### 4. Email Is from a Group or Distribution List

Group emails and distribution lists are excluded from sync.

**Solution**: This is expected behavior.

### 5. Folder Not Selected for Sync

If you're using the Message Folder feature, some folders might be excluded.

**Solution**: Go to **Settings → Accounts**, select your mailbox, and check folder sync settings.

### 6. Wrong Email Address on Record

The Person record might have a different email address than the one used in the email.

**Solution**: Add the correct email address to the Person record.

## Still Not Working?

1. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your mailbox
2. Contact support if issues persist
