description: Build and manage Twenty customizations as code.

<Warning>
Apps are currently in alpha testing. The feature is functional but still evolving.

## What Are Apps?

Apps let you build and manage Twenty customizations **as code**. Instead of configuring everything through the UI, you define your data model and serverless functions in code — making it faster to build, maintain, and roll out to multiple workspaces.

**What you can do today:**
- Define custom objects and fields as code (managed data model)
- Build serverless functions with custom triggers
- Deploy the same app across multiple workspaces

**Coming soon:**
- Custom UI layouts and components
