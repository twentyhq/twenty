description: Learn how to authenticate your API requests to Twenty.

## Overview

Twenty uses API keys for authentication. This guide walks you through creating and using API keys.

## Create an API Key

1. Go to **Settings → API & Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Create API Key**
3. Give your key a descriptive name
4. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)

## Use Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.twenty.com/rest/companies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Best Practices

- **Never share API keys** in public repositories or client-side code
- **Use descriptive names** to identify what each key is used for
- **Rotate keys regularly** for security
- **Delete unused keys** to minimize risk

## Assign Permissions

API keys can be assigned roles to control what they can access:

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Select or create a role
3. Open the **Assignment** tab
4. Under **API Keys**, assign the key
