description: Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications from Twenty.
---

## Overview

Webhooks notify your application when events happen in Twenty, enabling real-time integrations.

## Create a Webhook

1. Go to **Settings → API & Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Create Webhook**
3. Enter your endpoint URL
4. Select the events to subscribe to
5. Save the webhook

## Supported Events

Twenty can notify you when:
- Records are created, updated, or deleted
- Specific objects change (People, Companies, Opportunities, etc.)
- Custom object records are modified

## Handle Webhook Payloads

Your endpoint will receive POST requests with event data:

```json
{
  "event": "record.created",
  "object": "person",
  "data": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Return 200 quickly** — process data asynchronously
- **Verify the source** — validate webhook signatures
- **Handle duplicates** — webhooks may be sent more than once
- **Log payloads** — for debugging and auditing
