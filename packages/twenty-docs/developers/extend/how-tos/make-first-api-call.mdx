## Overview

This guide walks you through making your first API call to Twenty.

## Prerequisites

- A Twenty workspace
- An API key ([create one here](/developers/extend/how-tos/authenticate-with-api))

## REST API Example

Fetch all companies:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.twenty.com/rest/companies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Create a new person:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.twenty.com/rest/people" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": {
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Doe"
    },
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  }'
```

## GraphQL API Example

Query companies with GraphQL:

```graphql
query {
  companies(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        domainName
      }
    }
  }
}
```
