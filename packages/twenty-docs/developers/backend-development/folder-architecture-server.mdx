The backend directory structure is as follows:

```
server
  └───ability
  └───constants 
  └───core
  └───database
  └───decorators
  └───filters
  └───guards
  └───health
  └───integrations
  └───metadata
  └───workspace
  └───utils
```

## Ability

Defines permissions and includes handlers for each entity.

## Decorators 

Defines custom decorators in NestJS for added functionality. 

See [custom decorators](https://docs.nestjs.com/custom-decorators) for more details.

## Filters

Includes exception filters to handle exceptions that might occur in GraphQL endpoints. 

## Guards

See [guards](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards) for more details. 

## Health

Includes a publicly available REST API (healthz) that returns a JSON to confirm whether the database is working as expected.

## Metadata

Defines custom objects and makes available a GraphQL API (graphql/metadata).

## Workspace

Generates and serves custom GraphQL schema based on the metadata. 

### Workspace Directory Structure 

```
workspace

  └───workspace-schema-builder
    └───factories 
    └───graphql-types
    └───database
    └───interfaces
    └───object-definitions
    └───services
    └───storage
    └───utils
  └───workspace-resolver-builder
    └───factories
    └───interfaces
  └───workspace-query-builder
    └───factories
    └───interfaces
  └───workspace-query-runner
    └───interfaces
    └───utils 
  └───workspace-datasource
  └───workspace-manager
  └───workspace-migration-runner
  └───utils 
  └───workspace.module.ts   
  └───workspace.factory.spec.ts    
  └───workspace.factory.ts      
```


The root of the workspace directory includes the `workspace.factory.ts`, a file containing the `createGraphQLSchema` function. This function generates workspace-specific schema by using the metadata to tailor a schema for individual workspaces. By separating the schema and resolver construction, we use the `makeExecutableSchema` function, which combines these discrete elements. 

This strategy is not just about organization, but also helps with optimization, such as caching generated type definitions to enhance performance and scalability.

### Workspace Schema builder

Generates the GraphQL schema, and includes:  

#### Factories: 

Specialised constructors to generate GraphQL-related constructs.  
- The type.factory translates field metadata into GraphQL types using `TypeMapperService`.
- The type-definition.factory creates GraphQL input or output objects derived from `objectMetadata`.

#### GraphQL Types

Includes enumerations, inputs, objects, and scalars, and serves as the building blocks for the schema construction.

#### Interfaces and Object Definitions

Contains the blueprints for GraphQL entities, and includes both predefined and custom types like `MONEY` or `URL`.

#### Services

Contains the service responsible for associating FieldMetadataType with its appropriate GraphQL scalar or query modifiers.

#### Storage 

Includes the `TypeDefinitionsStorage` class that contains reusable type definitions, preventing duplication of GraphQL types.

### Workspace Resolver Builder 

Creates resolver functions for querying and mutating the GraphQL schema.

Each factory in this directory is responsible for producing a distinct resolver type, such as the `FindManyResolverFactory`, designed for adaptable application across various tables.

### Workspace Query Runner 

Runs the generated queries on the database and parses the result.
