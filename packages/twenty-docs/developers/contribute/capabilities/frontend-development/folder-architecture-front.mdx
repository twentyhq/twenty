title: Folder Architecture
info: A detailed look into our folder architecture
---


In this guide, you will explore the details of the project directory structure and how it contributes to the organization and maintainability of Twenty.

By following this folder architecture convention, it's easier to find the files related to specific features and ensure that the application is scalable and maintainable.

```
front
└───modules
│   └───module1
│   │   └───submodule1
│   └───module2
│   └───ui
│   │   └───display
│   │   └───inputs
│   │   │   └───buttons
│   │   └───...
└───pages
└───...
```

## Pages

Includes the top-level components defined by the application routes. They import more low-level components from the modules folder (more details below).

## Modules

Each module represents a feature or a group of feature, comprising its specific components, states, and operational logic.
They should all follow the structure below. You can nest modules within modules (referred to as submodules) and the same rules will apply.

```
module1
  └───components
  │   └───component1
  │   └───component2
  └───constants
  └───contexts
  └───graphql
  │   └───fragments
  │   └───queries
  │   └───mutations
  └───hooks
  │   └───internal
  └───states
  │   └───selectors
  └───types
  └───utils
```

### Contexts

A context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

See [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react#context-hooks) for more details.

### GraphQL

Includes fragments, queries, and mutations.

See [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) for more details.

- Fragments

A fragment is a reusable piece of a query, which you can use in different places. By using fragments, it's easier to avoid duplicating code.

See [GraphQL Fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) for more details.

- Queries

See [GraphQL Queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) for more details.

- Mutations

See [GraphQL Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) for more details.

### Hooks

See [Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) for more details.

### States

Contains the state management logic. [RecoilJS](https://recoiljs.org) handles this.

- Selectors: See [RecoilJS Selectors](https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/selectors) for more details.

React's built-in state management still handles state within a component.

### Utils

Should just contain reusable pure functions. Otherwise, create custom hooks in the `hooks` folder.


## UI

Contains all the reusable UI components used in the application.

This folder can contain sub-folders, like `data`, `display`, `feedback`, and `input` for specific types of components. Each component should be self-contained and reusable, so that you can use it in different parts of the application.

By separating the UI components from the other components in the `modules` folder, it's easier to maintain a consistent design and to make changes to the UI without affecting other parts (business logic) of the codebase.

## Interface and dependencies

You can import other module code from any module except for the `ui` folder. This will keep its code easy to test.

### Internal

Each part (hooks, states, ...) of a module can have an `internal` folder, which contains parts that are just used within the module.
