The twenty-sdk CLI to develop, build, and publish applications that extend Twenty.

Basic usage:

```bash filename="Terminal"
twenty [command] [options]
```


## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+ and Yarn 4
- A Twenty workspace and an API key. Generate one at https://app.twenty.com/settings/api-webhooks

## Installation

Install the SDK (which also installs the `twenty` CLI):

```bash
npm install twenty-sdk
# or
yarn add twenty-sdk
```

If you want to scaffold a full example, use [create-twenty-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-twenty-app):

```bash
npx create-twenty-app@latest my-twenty-app
cd my-twenty-app
```

## Usage

```
Usage: twenty [options] [command]

CLI for Twenty application development

Options:
  --workspace <name>   Use a specific workspace configuration (default: "default")
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -h, --help           display help for command

Commands:
  auth                 Authentication commands
  app                  Application development commands
  help [command]       display help for command
```

## Global Options

- `--workspace <name>`: Use a specific workspace configuration profile. Defaults to `default`. See Configuration for details.

## Commands

### Auth

Authenticate the CLI against your Twenty workspace.

- `twenty auth login` — Authenticate with Twenty.
  - Options:
    - `--api-key <key>`: API key for authentication.
    - `--api-url <url>`: Twenty API URL (defaults to your current profile's value or `http://localhost:3000`).
  - Behavior: Prompts for any missing values, persists them to the active workspace profile, and validates the credentials.

- `twenty auth logout` — Remove authentication credentials for the active workspace profile.

- `twenty auth status` — Print the current authentication status (API URL, masked API key, validity).

Examples:

```bash
# Login interactively (recommended)
twenty auth login

# Provide values in flags
twenty auth login --api-key $TWENTY_API_KEY --api-url https://api.twenty.com

# Login interactively for a specific workspace profile
twenty auth login --workspace my-custom-workspace

# Check status
twenty auth status

# Logout current profile
twenty auth logout
```

### App

Application development commands.

- `twenty app sync [appPath]` — One-time sync of the application to your Twenty workspace.
- Behavior: Compute your application's manifest and send it to your workspace to sync your application

- `twenty app dev [appPath]` — Watch and sync local application changes.
  - Options:
    - `-d, --debounce <ms>`: Debounce delay in milliseconds (default: `1000`).
  - Behavior: Performs an initial sync, then watches the directory for changes and re-syncs after debounced edits. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

- `twenty app uninstall [appPath]` — Uninstall the application from the current workspace.
  - Note: `twenty app delete` exists as a hidden alias for backward compatibility.

- `twenty app add [entityType]` — Add a new entity to your application.
  - Arguments:
    - `entityType`: one of `function` or `object`. If omitted, an interactive prompt is shown.
  - Options:
    - `--path <path>`: The path where the entity file should be created (relative to the current directory).
  - Behavior:
    - `object`: prompts for singular/plural names and labels, then creates a new object definition file.
    - `function`: prompts for a name and scaffolds a serverless function file.

- `twenty app generate [appPath]` — Generate the typed Twenty client for your application.

- `twenty app logs [appPath]` — Stream application function logs.
  - Options:
    - `-u, --functionUniversalIdentifier <id>`: Only show logs for a specific function universal ID.
    - `-n, --functionName <name>`: Only show logs for a specific function name.

Examples:

```bash
# Start dev mode with default debounce
twenty app dev

# Start dev mode with custom workspace profile
twenty app dev --workspace my-custom-workspace

# Dev mode with custom debounce
twenty app dev --debounce 1500

# One-time sync of the current directory
twenty app sync

# Add a new object interactively
twenty app add

# Generate client types
twenty app generate

# Watch all function logs
twenty app logs

# Watch logs for a specific function by name
twenty app logs -n my-function
```

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration per user in a JSON file:

- Location: `~/.twenty/config.json`
- Structure: Profiles keyed by workspace name. The active profile is selected with `--workspace <name>`.

Example configuration file:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "default": {
      "apiUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
      "apiKey": "<your-api-key>"
    },
    "prod": {
      "apiUrl": "https://api.twenty.com",
      "apiKey": "<your-api-key>"
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- If a profile is missing, `apiUrl` defaults to `http://localhost:3000` until set.
- `twenty auth login` writes the `apiUrl` and `apiKey` for the default profile.
- `twenty auth login --workspace custom-workspace` writes the `apiUrl` and `apiKey` for a custom `custom-workspace` profile.


## Troubleshooting

- Authentication errors: run `twenty auth login` and ensure the API key has the required permissions in your workspace.
- Cannot connect to server: verify the API URL and that the Twenty server is reachable.
- Types or client missing/outdated: run `twenty app generate` and then `twenty app sync`.
- Dev mode not syncing: ensure `twenty app dev` is running and that changes are not ignored by your environment (node_modules and .git are ignored by default).
