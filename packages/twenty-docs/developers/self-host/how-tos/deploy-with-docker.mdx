## Overview

Docker Compose is the fastest way to get Twenty running on your own infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- At least 4GB RAM available
- Ports 3000 and 5432 available

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
cd twenty
```

2. Copy the environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access Twenty at `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

Edit your `.env` file to customize:
- `APP_SECRET` — unique secret for your instance
- `FRONT_BASE_URL` — your public URL
- `POSTGRES_*` — database connection settings

## Verify Installation

Check that all services are running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see:
- `twenty-server` — API server
- `twenty-front` — Frontend application
- `twenty-postgres` — Database
