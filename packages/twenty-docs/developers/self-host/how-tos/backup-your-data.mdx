description: Create and restore backups of your self-hosted Twenty instance.

## Overview

Regular backups protect your CRM data from loss. This guide covers backup strategies for self-hosted Twenty.

## Database Backup

### Create a Backup

```bash
docker exec twenty-postgres pg_dump -U postgres twenty > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### Automate Daily Backups

Add to your crontab:

```bash
0 2 * * * docker exec twenty-postgres pg_dump -U postgres twenty > /backups/twenty_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql
```

## Restore from Backup

1. Stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose stop twenty-server twenty-front
```

2. Restore the database:
```bash
docker exec -i twenty-postgres psql -U postgres twenty < backup_20240115.sql
```

3. Restart services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Best Practices

- **Test restores regularly** — verify backups actually work
- **Store backups off-site** — use cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)
- **Encrypt sensitive data** — protect backups with encryption
- **Retain multiple copies** — keep daily, weekly, and monthly backups
