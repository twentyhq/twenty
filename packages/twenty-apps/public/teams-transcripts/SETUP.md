# Development

Use the Node version in `.nvmrc` and Yarn 4. From this directory:

```bash
yarn install --immutable
yarn lint
yarn typecheck
yarn test:unit
yarn twenty dev:build
```

Installation tests use a disposable Twenty workspace. Configure
`TWENTY_API_URL` and `TWENTY_API_KEY` for that workspace, then run `yarn test`.
The test setup installs and uninstalls the application; do not use the shared QA
workspace. Public apps use the monorepo CI workflows.
