# Set environment values for your application here.
# Use the format: KEY=value
#
# These variables are automatically loaded when running your serverless functions.
# You can access them directly in your code using:
# const myValue = process.env.KEY;
#
# To make these variables available to your application,
# add them to package.json "env" key. This "env" key defines all
# environment variables that will be provided to your serverless
# functions at runtime.
#
# Example:
# API_TOKEN=your-api-token
# TIMEOUT_MS=3000
