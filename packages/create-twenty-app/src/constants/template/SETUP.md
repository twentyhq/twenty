# Setup

Follow these steps to get your app running locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- Yarn 4
- Docker (to run the local Twenty server)

## Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   This project ships a `yarn.lock` pinning every dependency to an exact,
   integrity-checked version. If you would rather resolve the tree yourself —
   for example because you enforce a minimum release age on new packages —
   delete `yarn.lock` before the first install.

2. Start the local Twenty server:

   ```bash
   yarn twenty docker:start
   ```

   Check the server status at any time with `yarn twenty docker:status`.

3. Start the development server and sync your app:

   ```bash
   yarn twenty dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:2020](http://localhost:2020) and log in with the default development credentials: `tim@apple.dev` / `tim@apple.dev`.

## Verifying your setup

- `yarn lint` - Lint the project with oxlint
- `yarn typecheck` - Type-check the project
- `yarn test:unit` - Run unit tests
- `yarn test` - Run integration tests
