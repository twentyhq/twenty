This is a [Twenty](https://twenty.com) application project bootstrapped with [`create-twenty-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-twenty-app).

## Getting Started

First, authenticate to your workspace:

```bash
yarn auth
```

Then, start development mode to sync your app and watch for changes:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Or run a one-time sync:

```bash
yarn sync
```

Open your Twenty instance and go to `/settings/applications` section to see the result.

## Available Commands

```bash
yarn auth           # Authenticate with Twenty
yarn dev            # Start dev mode (sync + watch)
yarn sync           # One-time sync
yarn create-entity  # Add a new entity (function, object, role)
yarn generate       # Generate typed Twenty client
yarn logs           # Stream function logs
yarn uninstall      # Uninstall app from workspace
yarn help           # Display help
```
